Implementation:
        - To our knowledge both the decompression and compression have been 
          implemented fully and correctly

Architecture:
        - Our overall program was structured into modules with each module 
          holding one step for compression and its inverse (or corresponding 
          step) for decompression. We chose to structure it in this way because
          each level of the conversion process needs to know the same 
          information for both compression and decompression. In total we had 
          four modules:

            - image_io           
               -  handles reading from input and printing output
            - rgb_cv_trans       
               -  handles converting Pnmppm image to a component video image 
                  representation and the inverse conversion.
            - cv_codeword_trans  
               -  handles converting from a component video representation 
                  to a binary image
            - bitpack
               -  handles packing, unpacking, and changing bits in a 64 bit 
                  word

        - For the modules which handle conversions between images, namely 
          rgb_cv_trans and cv_codeword_trans, we map through an image applying
          a conversion function to each pixel representation. The result is 
          placed in a separate two-dimensional image representation which is 
          either used in the next conversion step, or sent to output.

        - The modules listed are used in compress40 which is in turn used by 
          the client, in our case 40image. As a result of this abstraction, 
          the methods of conversion are hidden from the client; all the client
          needs to do is specify compression or decompression.
