This repo contains my solutions to Tufts comp40 [**Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming**](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/40/). In this course, we finished a lot of interesting projects written in C. We also wrote some programs in assembly language. 

In this course, we learned pair programming. So All the assignments are finished by me and my partner. (We have different partner for different assignments).

Note: You should not see my solutions if you are taking comp40 or you plan to. You will learn a lot by doing these assignments with your partner. 

Note: Some people say this course is the most difficult cs course at Tufts University. I'm not sure about this, but I do spend more than 30+ hours every week in the lab doing these projects with my partner. I got A+ for this course and I really enjoyed it.
