Acknowledgments:
        - We were helped by several of the course staff including but not
          limited to Carter Casey and Tom Hebb.
        - We used the course website for guidelines and guidance.
        - We utilized the benchmark programs midmark.um, advent.umz and 
            sandmark.umz to measure our progress.
        - We also referenced numerous Piazza.

Routine taking most time: Our programs most expensive operation is the for loop
                          and switch statement which executes each command. To 
                          be more clear, there are seven assembly instructions
                          which increment the counter, jumps program to top of 
                          loop and accesses the jump table built by the switch 
                          statement. These actions, while taking 28% of our 
                          programs time, are necessary. The other large time 
                          sink is in memory allocation/deallocation and 
                          initializing new memory to a zero state. This is a 
                          critical task which must be done. Finally, some small
                          amount of time could be saved by breaking the Seg.h 
                          abstraction barrier, but it was not deemed significant
                          and therefore was left along. This time would be
                          mainly saved by reducing the number of pointers
                          followed in order to access a segment address.
Time Spent:
        - Analyzing                             5  hours
        - Solving Problems after Analysis       8 hours
