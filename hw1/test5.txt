    Conditional jump depends on unitialized value Valgrind

        Hi, I am really lost here, I have airport class which should navigate planes, in its list to runways, with method move, theres a method prepare which changes the direction of flight to all planes, always before move is called, move just increments decrement x and y of plane in its list. But after calling two times in row airport->move(), I get screwed and I really dont know wheres the problem. Have I badly initiazed something? Iterator gets invalidated.

        Thanks for help.

            }
            return true;
        }
        This is the method where it fails.
        When I call it once, no problem, after second call I get instead of normal number in cout<<after move<< s1 i get like 8795456
        Dunno why.

        Look at this code in airport::move().

        Code:
        ?
        1
        2
        3
        4
        5
        6
        7
        8
        	
        if((*planeIteratorMoj)->move())
        {
            delete *planeIteratorMoj;
        }
         
        plane * p2 = (*planeIteratorMoj);
        int s1,w1;
        p2->getPosition(s1,w1);
        Immediately after deleting *planeIteratorMoj, this code dereferences *planeIteratorMoj.



        Logically, I would query the notion of an airport being able to move. Airports are often geographically fixed entities, that can't move. Either the function airport::move() is poorly named, or the logic of your design is deficient. Or both.

        p2 is there just for debbuging reasons,
        Airport has a list<plane*> and they have iterator planeIteratorMoj , so in the cycle i am calling function move in class plane, on instance of plane, if condition is true it means plane has landed and can be deleted.

        I want to ask you another thing, as I said I have list<plane*> where are correctly dynamically allocated instances of plane.
        If I have for cycle
        Code:

        for(planeIteratorMoj = planes.begin(); planeIteratorMoj!= planes.end(); planeIteratorMoj++)    {
                (*planeIteratorMoj)->move();
            }
        }

        As you can see function move in plane class is in my first topic, just increments internal variables of plane, are those changes correctly saved, so the plane inside a list has changed its position?

        Ironically, the p2 may be there for debugging reasons, but what you're doing with it introduces a bug. If you are going to add code for debugging purposes, you need to be sure it works.

        Take out the references to p2 and the vector, and your code is equivalent to
        Code:
        ?
        1
        2
        	
        delete x;
        x->getPosition(s1,w1);     // undefined behaviour here!
        As to your question, if all you're doing in the loop is changing the state of elements, that is fine. It is operations that change the vector itself (eg resizing it) that you need to be careful of, due to potential of invalidating iterators.

        Incidentally, don't rely on everyone reading your previous posts. With the number of people here, and number of topics, not everyone will read everything. And not everyone will bother to remember every small detail of your posts anyway. While I remember responding to your previous thread, I certainly haven't remembered the exquisite details of the code you posted in it.

        In your original example:

        Code:
        ?
        1
        2
        3
        4
        	
        if((*planeIteratorMoj)->move())
        {
            delete *planeIteratorMoj;
        }
        You have a list of pointers to planes. This delete will delete the plane, but it won't remove the pointer from the list (i.e. list.size() will be the same).
        So on a subsquent call to airport::move(), the list of planes will have some pointers to freed memory.

        You probably want to delete the plane, and remove the pointer from the list. You can do that with list::erase list::erase - C++ Reference

        When you erase an element this way, the iterator to it becomes invalid, so you can't increment it. I'd suggest a while loop:
        Code:
        ?
        1
        2
        3
        4
        5
        6
        7
        8
        	
        while (iter != thelist.end())
        {
           // do stuff
           if (condition to delete element)
               iter = thelist.erase(iter); 
           else
               iter++;
        }

        I'm surprised valgrind didn't give you a specific diagnostic about this: saying freed memory had been accessed.

        If you compile your code with debug information (-g), then valgrind can tell you the source line that caused a problem.

        This:

        Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
        ==26207== at 0x409601: plane::move() (in /home/xnovak11/Downloads/airport/main)
        I'd guess this is:
        Code:
        ?
        1
        2
        3
        4
        	
        if(_hasLanded)
        {
            return false;
        }
        You don't seem to have set _hasLanded anywhere, at least not in the code you've posted.

        Also, you said:
        if condition is true it means plane has landed and can be deleted.
        which is the opposite of what this code is doing.

<cfloat> (float.h)
Characteristics of floating-point types
This header describes the characteristics of floating types for the specific system and compiler implementation used.

A floating-point number is composed of four elements:

    a sign: either negative or non-negative
    a base (or radix): which expresses the different numbers that can be represented with a single digit (2 for binary, 10 for decimal, 16 for hexadecimal, and so on...)
    a significand (or mantissa): which is a series of digits of the aforementioned base. The number of digits in this series is what is known as precision.
    an exponent (also known as characteristic, or scale): which represents the offset of the significand, affecting the value in the following way:
    value of floating-point = significand x baseexponent, with its corresponding sign.


Macro constants
The following panel shows the name of the different values defined in this header and their minimal or maximal values for all implementations (particula rimplementations may have values greater or smaller, as specified):

When a group of macros exists prefixed by FLT_, DBL_ and LDBL_, the one beginning with FLT_ applies to the float type, the one with DBL_ to double and the one with LDBL_ to long double.

name    value   stands for  expresses
FLT_RADIX   

2 or greater    

    RADIX   Base for all floating-point types (float, double and long double).
FLT_MANT_DIG
DBL_MANT_DIG
LDBL_MANT_DIG       MANTissa DIGits Precision of significand, i.e. the number of digits that conform the significand.
FLT_DIG
DBL_DIG
LDBL_DIG    6 or greater
10 or greater
10 or greater   DIGits  Number of decimal digits that can be rounded into a floating-point and back without change in the number of decimal digits.
FLT_MIN_EXP
DBL_MIN_EXP
LDBL_MIN_EXP        MINimum EXPonent    Minimum negative integer value for the exponent that generates a normalized floating-point number.
FLT_MIN_10_EXP
DBL_MIN_10_EXP
LDBL_MIN_10_EXP -37 or smaller
-37 or smaller
-37 or smaller  MINimum base-10 EXPonent    Minimum negative integer value for the exponent of a base-10 expression that would generate a normalized floating-point number.
FLT_MAX_EXP
DBL_MAX_EXP
LDBL_MAX_EXP        MAXimum EXPonent    Maximum integer value for the exponent that generates a normalized floating-point number.
FLT_MAX_10_EXP
DBL_MAX_10_EXP
LDBL_MAX_10_EXP 37 or greater
37 or greater
37 or greater   MAXimum base-10 EXPonent    Maximum integer value for the exponent of a base-10 expression that would generate a normalized floating-point number.
FLT_MAX
DBL_MAX
LDBL_MAX    1E+37 or greater
1E+37 or greater
1E+37 or greater    MAXimum Maximum finite representable floating-point number.
FLT_EPSILON
DBL_EPSILON
LDBL_EPSILON    1E-5 or smaller
1E-9 or smaller
1E-9 or smaller EPSILON Difference between 1 and the least value greater than 1 that is representable.
FLT_MIN
DBL_MIN
LDBL_MIN    1E-37 or smaller
1E-37 or smaller
1E-37 or smaller    MINimum Minimum representable floating-point number.
FLT_ROUNDS      ROUND   Rounding behavior. Possible values:
-1 undetermined
 0 toward zero
 1 to nearest
 2 toward positive infinity
 3 toward negative infinity
Applies to all floating-point types (float, double and long double).
FLT_EVAL_METHOD     EVALuation METHOD   Properties of the evaluation format. Possible values:
-1 undetermined
 0 evaluate just to the range and precision of the type
 1 evaluate float and double as double, and long double as long double.
 2 evaluate all as long double Other negative values indicate an implementation-defined behavior.
Applies to all floating-point types (float, double and long double).
DECIMAL_DIG     DECIMAL DIGits  Number of decimal digits that can be rounded into a floating-point type and back again to the same decimal digits, without loss in precision.

Compatibility
FLT_EVAL_METHOD and DECIMAL_DIG are defined for libraries complying with the C standard of 1999 or later (which only includes the C++ standard since 2011: C++11).

    Conditional jump depends on unitialized value Valgrind

        Hi, I am really lost here, I have airport class which should navigate planes, in its list to runways, with method move, theres a method prepare which changes the direction of flight to all planes, always before move is called, move just increments decrement x and y of plane in its list. But after calling two times in row airport->move(), I get screwed and I really dont know wheres the problem. Have I badly initiazed something? Iterator gets invalidated.

        Thanks for help.

        Valgrind Stacktrace
        Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)

        This is the method where it fails.
        When I call it once, no problem, after second call I get instead of normal number in cout<<after move<< s1 i get like 8795456

        Look at this code in airport::move().

        Code:
        ?
        1
        2
        3
        4
        5
        6
        7
        8
            
        if((*planeIteratorMoj)->move())
        {
            delete *planeIteratorMoj;
        }
         
        plane * p2 = (*planeIteratorMoj);
        int s1,w1;
        p2->getPosition(s1,w1);
        Immediately after deleting *planeIteratorMoj, this code dereferences *planeIteratorMoj.



        Logically, I would query the notion of an airport being able to move. Airports are often geographically fixed entities, that can't move. Either the function airport::move() is poorly named, or the logic of your design is deficient. Or both.

        p2 is there just for debbuging reasons,
        Airport has a list<plane*> and they have iterator planeIteratorMoj , so in the cycle i am calling function move in class plane, on instance of plane, if condition is true it means plane has landed and can be deleted.

        I want to ask you another thing, as I said I have list<plane*> where are correctly dynamically allocated instances of plane.
        If I have for cycle
        Code:

        for(planeIteratorMoj = planes.begin(); planeIteratorMoj!= planes.end(); planeIteratorMoj++)    {
                (*planeIteratorMoj)->move();
            }
        }

        As you can see function move in plane class is in my first topic, just increments internal variables of plane, are those changes correctly saved, so the plane inside a list has changed its position?

        Ironically, the p2 may be there for debugging reasons, but what you're doing with it introduces a bug. If you are going to add code for debugging purposes, you need to be sure it works.

        Take out the references to p2 and the vector, and your code is equivalent to
        Code:
        ?
        1
        2
            
        delete x;
        x->getPosition(s1,w1);     // undefined behaviour here!
        As to your question, if all you're doing in the loop is changing the state of elements, that is fine. It is operations that change the vector itself (eg resizing it) that you need to be careful of, due to potential of invalidating iterators.

        Incidentally, don't rely on everyone reading your previous posts. With the number of people here, and number of topics, not everyone will read everything. And not everyone will bother to remember every small detail of your posts anyway. While I remember responding to your previous thread, I certainly haven't remembered the exquisite details of the code you posted in it.

        In your original example:

        Code:
        ?
        1
        2
        3
        4
            
        if((*planeIteratorMoj)->move())
        {
            delete *planeIteratorMoj;
        }
        You have a list of pointers to planes. This delete will delete the plane, but it won't remove the pointer from the list (i.e. list.size() will be the same).
        So on a subsquent call to airport::move(), the list of planes will have some pointers to freed memory.

        You probably want to delete the plane, and remove the pointer from the list. You can do that with list::erase list::erase - C++ Reference

        When you erase an element this way, the iterator to it becomes invalid, so you can't increment it. I'd suggest a while loop:
        Code:
        ?
        1
        2
        3
        4
        5
        6
        7
        8
            
        while (iter != thelist.end())
        {
           // do stuff
           if (condition to delete element)
               iter = thelist.erase(iter); 
           else
               iter++;
        }

        I'm surprised valgrind didn't give you a specific diagnostic about this: saying freed memory had been accessed.

        If you compile your code with debug information (-g), then valgrind can tell you the source line that caused a problem.

        This:

        Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
        ==26207== at 0x409601: plane::move() (in /home/xnovak11/Downloads/airport/main)
        I'd guess this is:
        Code:
        ?
        1
        2
        3
        4
            
        if(_hasLanded)
        {
            return false;
        }
        You don't seem to have set _hasLanded anywhere, at least not in the code you've posted.

        Also, you said:
        if condition is true it means plane has landed and can be deleted.
        which is the opposite of what this code is doing.

Summary of the Assignment

In this assignment you will design, build and test two application programs and one supporting file input routine. The first program reports the average brightness of an image file. The second program reports similarities in file data, and it uses an input routine called readaline that you will implement. That input routine must conform to an interface that we provide.

The primary specifications for these programs are contained in the sections Part A (Brightness), Part B (Read a Line) and Part C (Similarities in Files) below.

Note that for Part B, you get partial credit for a limited implementation that only handles short input lines. We strongly urge you to implement that limited version first, then go on and complete Part C, and only if you have time go back to enhance Part B for full credit. You will lose much more credit for doing a poor job on Part C than for failing to handle long lines in Part B.
Background and preparation

The sections below give information about the purpose of this assignment, as well as other background you should understand before starting work.
Purpose of this assignment

This assignment has several goals:

    To teach you to work in pairs on assignments that are more challenging than you have encountered before
    To help you make the transition from C++ programming to the kind of C programming we expect in COMP 40
    To start you thinking about the interface as a unit of design
    To give you practice in identifying interfaces and existing implementations that can help you solve problems
    To give you experience reading and conforming exactly to specifications, such as the those contained in this document
    To start to convince you that writing good test cases, not just for correct or obvious input but also for edge cases and error cases, is as important as writing good program code
    To give you experience teaching yourself about languages like C, systems like Linux, and system features like stdin, fopen, etc.
    To give you experience working with a partner to design, document, implement and test a computer program
    To introduce you to multiple representations of numbers

We understand that assignments like this will take you out of your comfort zone. When you read these instructions there will be many things that at first you won't understand. Not everything you need to know will be explained to you in detail.

These are the challenges that professional programmers and computer scientists face every day. Stick with it, figure things out, use the system documentation, get help. You may not succeed completely at everything we ask of you even by the end of the assignment, although it's certainly possible and many students do. Experience shows that over time almost all of you will learn not just to build programs like these, but also to teach yourself about the language features and tools that you need.
C vs. C++, and Hanson's Interfaces and Implementations

The C language is for the most part a proper subset of C++. Indeed, C came first and was only many years later extended to add object orientation, parameterized types and other higher-level features features. Note that both languages are very widely used to this day.

So, why C in comp 40? A primary goal of COMP 40 is to teach you how computers work, and to show you how modern software uses the hardware on which it runs. You will find that C, being a smaller and simpler language, translates much more directly to hardware primitives. Furthermore, working in C allows us to build ourselves many of the higher-level features whose implementation is hidden in the runtimes of more complex languages. So, using C we learn more about the internal workings of languages like C++ (and Java and Python, etc.)

Although C itself does not include the sorts of high-level structures like Lists, Sets, or hash-based Tables/Maps you might find in C++ or Java, we in COMP 40 give you implementations by Dave Hanson. We expect you to use these rather than building your own, and we offer them as examples of interesting, well-written C code from which you can learn. There is an online Quick Reference guide at http://ciibook.webhop.net/pdf/quickref.pdf Note: the Hanson Array class is not available for use in COMP 40, and is not needed for this assignment. Of course, you are also encouraged where appropriate to use C language structs, arrays, etc.

You will find some useful information for new C programmers in the section below titled: General advice for new C programmers Although we will give you some hints like these about the differences between C and C++, we also expect to to teach yourselves many of the details. Other good sources include the books that we have recommended, online resources, etc. Help each other learn! In COMP 40 you must not share work on your solutions, but you are welcome to work with your fellow students to learn new languages and technologies.
Setting up your environment

    To add the course binaries to your execution path, run

    use comp40

    You may want to put this command in your .cshrc or your .profile:

    use -q comp40

    Without the -q, you may have difficulties with scp, ssh, git, and rsync.

    To get started:

      git clone /comp/40/git/filesnpix

    You will get two files: compile and Makefile. You should leave the compile script alone: it's a program that just runs make. It's there for legacy reasons as we transition the course from compile scripts to makefiles. Use make and the Makefile to build your programs. Depending on how you structure your code, you may have to make minor modifications to the Makefile so that it will compile and link together the correct source modules for your projects. The handout A simple introduction to Compile Scripts and Makefiles (concentrate on the Makefile part) should give you the information you need. In later projects you will likely have to make more extensive modifications to Makefiles, so you should read and learn about them so you understand what they're doing. The Makefile for Lab 0 and this one are intended as gentle introductions: we will gradually make use of more sophisticated features of make as the semester progresses. (You may want to compare this one to the Lab 0 Makefile to see what I mean.)

Getting started with Hanson's Interfaces and Implementations

For Part C: Similarities in files you will need several of the C interfaces and implementations David Hanson. You'll also need a general understanding of Hansons conventions, exceptions for assertions in error handling, etc. for Part A: Brightness.

    To get started, read Chapters 1 and 2 (pages 1–31) of Hanson's book.
    To learn what Hanson has built for you, skim the beginnings of the relevant chapters: pages 45–52, pages 33–34, pages 103–107, pages 115–118 (pages 118–125 recommended), pages 137–140, pages 161–164, pages 171–173, and the first sections of Chapters 15 and 16, which I don't have the page numbers for. 

Other preparation

Be sure you have read the course policies, especially notes on the general expectations for COMP 40 homework (including all subsections!), collaboration, guidelines for pair programming and the course coding standards. Note that terminology definitions (e.g. for the term Checked Runtime Error), and the expectations set in the sections on Homework Grades and Errors, Exceptions, Output, Valgrind and Grades etc. are implicitly part of the specifications for all COMP 40 homework, including this one.

We emphasize again that pair programming is required for all COMP 40 assignments. It is your responsibility to understand and abide by the COMP 40 policies on pair programming. If you have not been assigned a partner or do not have permission to work separately (such permission is very rare), please contact the instructor immediately! You will get no credit if you work alone unless you have permission.
Part A: Brightness of a grayscale image
Please write a C program brightness that prints the average brightness of a grayscale image. Every pixel in a grayscale image has a brightness between 0 and 1, where 0 is black and 1 is as bright as possible.
Specification

Print to standard output a single newline-terminated line containing the average brightness of the supplied image. The brightness should be printed in decimal notation with exactly one digit before the decimal point and three digits after the decimal point.

The program takes at most one argument:

    If an argument is given, it should be the name of a portable graymap file (in pgm format).
    If no argument is given, brightness reads from standard input, which should contain a portable graymap.
    If more than one argument is given, brightness halts with an error (see below).
    If a portable graymap is promised but not delivered, brightness halts with an error (see below). 

Where the specification above requires that you halt with an error, you have two choices:

    You may print an error message on stderr and exit your program using exit(EXIT_FAILURE) from stdlib.h
    You may exit with a failed assertion or other Hanson-style Checked Runtime Exception (see explanation of CREs in the Hanson book)

When exiting due to such an error you must not produce any output on stdout.
Examples of Brightness in Use

    Here are two photos:
    black cat in a coal cellar at midnight  polar bear in a snowstorm
    Black cat in coal cellar    Polar bear in snowstorm

    If cellar.pgm is a picture of a black cat in a coal cellar at midnight, and if bear.jpg is a picture of a polar bear in an snowstorm, then output should look something like this:

    sunfire33{noah}: brightness cellar.pgm
    0.000
    sunfire33{noah}: djpeg -grayscale bear.jpg | brightness
    0.972
    sunfire33{noah}: 

    The first example takes its input from a file named on the command line, and the second example takes its input from standard input, as part of a Unix pipeline. 

My solution to this problem takes fewer than 35 lines of C code.
Help with image files
We provide code to help you read image files; you will find the Pnmrdr interface in /comp/40/include and the implementation in /comp/40/lib64. If you use the supplied Makefile, these should be found automatically when your code needs them. Creating a Pnmrdr_T will read the graymap header for you, and from the header you can compute how many pixels are in the image. (You should read exactly as many pixels as are there—no more, no fewer.) Don't forget that the brightness of each pixel is represented as a scaled integer, as described in the Pnmrdr interface.
Getting images
You can get images to play with by using one or more of the following programs:

    djpeg (use the -grayscale option)
    pngtopnm
    pstopnm
    ppmtopgm 

Problem analysis and advice
The main issues here are:

    In place of much of the C++ technique you already know, you have new C techniques to learn. The ideas are all similar, like old wine; C is a new bottle.
    You will have to read and understand the interface for Pnmrdr, and you will have to understand a little bit about the pgm image format.
    You will have to do something appropriate if somebody hands you input that is not a portable graymap.

    There is a subtlety here: we are asking you to use Pnm_rdr to read image files, and we are also sending a strong signal that your programs should be careful to check for and handle erroneous input. What if Pnm_rdr fails to detect an error in what is supposed to be an image file? Answer: for this assignment and others in COMP 40, don't worry about it. The whole purpose of using Pnm_rdr is to hide from you details of how the image file is represented on disk. Therefore, it's inappropriate to ask you to do more checking than Pnm_rdr does.

    Of course, if this were a commercial program that might not be good enough: you would have to do due diligence to check that Pnm_rdr was indeed detecting all significant errors. For our purposes, just trust that it does.
    You are still responsible for making sure that when Pnm_rdr does detect an error in the image file, your program reports the error in an appropriate way. Maybe or maybe not this will involve writing nontrivial code.
    You will have to understand the compile-time and link-time options that gcc needs to work with the Pnmrdr interface (-I/comp/40/include and -L/comp/40/lib64 -lpnmrdr). A good start would be to understand the Makefile you received for this assignment (and you can also look in A simple introduction to Compile Scripts and Makefiles, which is for a previous version of this assignment, but is carefully explained there).
    To get the Makefile for this program, you must (if you didn't already):

      git clone /comp/40/git/filesnpix

    This will create a filesnpix directory with the compile script in it.
    You'll have to deal with two representations of real numbers between 0 and 1. 

There is also an important issue of style:

    When using an enumeration literal such as Pnmrdr_gray, refer to it by name, not by number. 

Part B: Read a line

Please create a single source file named readaline.c. Within that file you must:

    Include the header file readaline.h using #include. (The header file itself is provided for you in /comp/40/include, which is in the include path if you use the provided Makefile.)
    Implement a single function named readaline, conforming to the function declaration in the header file, which is:

    size_t readaline(FILE *inputfp, char **datap);

We will separately test and grade the correctness of your implementation of this function. You will also use the function in Part C below, so problems with this function can also affect your grade on that. Test carefully (and then test again!)

Do not make a copy of readaline.h in your project directory! Your submission will not be accepted if you do. If your compiles fail when including that header file there is almost surely something wrong with your Makefile.
readaline specification

The purpose of this function is to read a single line of input from file inputfp, which is presumed to have been opened for reading. As is common in specifications for computer programs and interfaces, we carefully define some terms, and then use those to specify the behavior of readaline:

    The term character refers to any of the 256 characters of ISO Latin-1 extended ASCII. The bytes in the input file are interpreted as such characters.
    The characters comprising each file are grouped into zero or more lines as follows:
        Each line contains at least one character
        New lines begin at the start of the file, and after each newline character ('\n')
        Each newline character is included in the line that it terminates
    Each invocation of readaline retrieves the next unread line in the file. The characters comprising the line are placed into a contiguous array of bytes, and *datap is set to the address of of the first byte. readaline returns the number of bytes in the line.
    The array of bytes is allocated by readaline using malloc (or the related allocation functions described in man 3 malloc.) It is the responsibility of the caller of readaline to free the array using free.
    readaline leaves the file seek pointer at the first (i. e., unread) character of the following line (if any) or at EOF
    If readaline is called when there are no more lines to be read, it sets *datap to NULL and returns 0.
    readaline terminates with a Checked Runtime Error in any of the following situations:
        Either or both of the supplied arguments is NULL
        An error is encountered reading from the file
        Memory allocation fails
    readaline must not cause memory leaks. That is, it must not leave allocated any dynamically acquired memory other than that returned to the caller through *datap. 

For handling input lines you MUST NOT use the system library routines getline or getdelim, and you must not consult the man pages or other documentation relating to them. Reason: we want you to learn to do the work of reading input lines yourself.
Partial credit

For full credit, your readaline implementation must support input lines of any size. Significant partial credit is available if you support input files in which no line exceeds 200 characters in length, including any new line character. If you read a line that is longer than your implementation can handle, your readaline MUST write the message:

readaline: input line too long\n

to stderr and must immediate cause the program to exit with status code = 4 by calling the system function exit(4) (You learned to call exit() in Part A.)
Hints

A few hints:

    The datap parameter to readaline is a call by reference (CBR) parameter, i.e., it's used for function output.

    Analogy: “Please slip the address of the party under my door.” In this case, there are two locations involved: the location of the party, and the location where we want location of the party to be stored (under the door).

    Application: For this function, the caller wants access to the data in the next line. The readaline function will collect the data and store it somewhere (that's where the party is). The caller is asking readaline to store the location of the data in a location it has access to. That's what *datap refers to.

    Draw a stack diagram. Stack diagrams are not analogies or “the way you think about how functions work”; they are precise descriptions of what actually happens in the computer. Therefore, you want to get these right, and there is a definite right way to draw these. Please ask the course staff for help, but try to draw it out first. Then you can explain your thinking to a member of the course staff, and we can applaud your insight or correct misunderstandings as appropriate.
    Under the covers, Hanson's ALLOC and NEW macros use malloc. So, you have a choice: if you are more comfortable using malloc and friends directly, go ahead. If you prefer the extra error-checking provided by Hanson's macros, you may use them. (FWIW: Norman Ramsey prefers Hanson's versions, Noah Mendelsohn is generally more comfortable with malloc. Either will get you full credit if used properly.)
    You will want to come up with some strategy for carefully testing your readaline function. Of course, you could just use it in your Part C simlines program and hope everything works, but we think you'll find that debugging is actually much harder that way. When something goes wrong (as it almost surely will), you will have to look everywhere to find the problem. Therefore: we strongly urge you to come up with a strategy for carefully testing readaline by itself.
    Question: according to the specification, is there any file you cannot read in its entirety by repeatedly calling your readaline function? Think about it. Why or why not? (You do not need to submit your answer.) Make sure your implementation can handle every file that the specification requires. Design your test cases accordingly.
    Handling lines of arbitrary size may be trickier than you think. DO NOT spend all your time trying to implement that at the cost of not getting to Part C. As noted above, you will get significant partial credit for both parts B and C if you can handle lines of at least 200 characters (you will use your readaline implementation in part C). We suggest you plan for longer lines, but for a start support only the 200 character minimum. Go on to part C and get that running. If you get all of that working, go back and extend readaline to handle longer lines. In principle, your Part C program should immediately start working with longer lines too!
    The size_t return type is an integer large enough to hold the number of bytes in the largest supported file on our Linux system. It is a standard type defined in stddef.h and used for this purpose by system library routines such as fread. 

Part C: Similarities in files

You are to write a program named simlines, the purpose of which is to read one or more data files to detect lines in the files that are similar to each other. Below we give you a detailed specification of what the program must do. Informally, it reads through one or more files looking for cases in which two or more lines contain the same words in the same order. It produces on standard output a report with a section for each such list of words, indicating which line numbers in which files contain those words.
simlines specification overview

The specification for simlines is as follows:

    The simlines program accepts zero or more command line arguments, each of which is the name of a file
    The program identifies all cases in which two or more lines in any of the input files are "similar" to each other, where similarity is determined by the definition below
    Similarities are reported if they occur within any single file and/or if lines in more than one of the files are similar
    The program writes its results to standard output in exactly the form specified for output below
    The simlines program raises a Checked Runtime Error if any of the following occur:
        Any one or more of the named input files cannot be opened
        An error is encountered reading from any of the input files
        Memory cannot be allocated using malloc

    If any of these situations arise, the program produces no output on stdout. The output on stderr must be only what is produced by the default Checked Runtime Error exception handler.
    If the same file is named more than once on the command line, then it is read and processed repeatedly, once for each command line reference. Note that this is very likely to result in similarities being detected and reported, since files are mostly similar to themselves!
    You MUST use your implementation of readaline from part B to read the data. If you are using a partial credit version of readaline that supports input lines of limited length, then you must rely on the error handling specified in part B to exit from simlines if an unsupported long input line is encountered.

Definition of line similarity

The following gives the rules for determining whether two lines are similar:

    The terms character and line have the same definition as in the specifications for readaline
    A word character is any of lowercase 'a' - 'z'; uppercase 'A' - 'Z'; the digit characters '0' - '9', and the underscore character '_' (which is ASCII code 95 decimal). All other characters are non-word characters
    Any contiguous grouping of word characters is a word. As common sense would suggest the term always refers to the largest possible groupings, thus the line:

        'abc  def'


    contains the two words abc and def, but not the words ab, ef or a.
    Thus any line contains zero or more words, optionally preceded, followed by and/or separated by non-word characters.
    Two lines are similar if and only if they contain the same words in the same order. Note that non-word characters are significant only as separators. Thus, the following lines are all similar to each other:

        'abc  def'
        'abc    def'
        '  abc    def '
        'abc,def'

    Lines containing no words (including empty lines) are not similar to other lines containing no words 

Simlines output specification

We define the term match group to refer to any set of two or more lines in the input file(s) that are similar. Such lines contain the same words in the same order, and we refer to that ordered list of words as the matching words list.

The output written to stdout by simlines must conform exactly to the following specification:

    There is one output section for each match group.
    If there is more than one match group, the corresponding output sections are separated from each other by a single additional newline (\n). The sections may appear in any order.
    If a match group contains n matches, then the corresponding output section consists of n+1 newline-terminated lines:
        The first line of each output group contains the list of match words, separated from each other (if there is more than one) by a single space '  ' character.
        For each match, a line consisting of:
            The name of the file in which the match occurred, exactly as specified in the corresponding commandline argument. The name is printed left justified (i.e. starting at the beginning of the line), and padded to the right with blanks to fill a total of 20 characters. If the filename is longer than 20 characters, then it is written in its entirety, but with no additional padding.
            A single additional space (typically the 21st character, unless the file name was long)
            A right justified seven digit integer giving the line number in which the match occurred. Line numbering is 1-based, i.e. the first line in the file is line 1, the second line 2, etc. No leading zeros are included in the line numbers.
        Within a match group the lines corresponding to each match are written in order. That is all matches in the file named by the first command line argument appear ahead of those in the files that follow. If there are multiple matches in a single file, they are written in order of increasing line number.
    As noted above, the same file named repeatedly on the command line results in no special processing: the file is read repeatedly, almost surely resulting in similar lines in the output, and those lines must be reported in order according to where the file references were in the command line. E.g. the command

    simlines testfile otherfile testfile

    might well result in an output group like this:

    hello world
    testfile-------------------2
    otherfile------------------7
    testfile-------------------2

    If testfile contained the words "hello world" on line 2, and otherfile contain the same words on line 7. (The light gray dashes in the sample output above are spaces in the actual output of simlines; the dashes are shown above to make the spaces easier to count.)

A consequence of the above rules is that simlines produces no output if there are no matches.
Hints

Here are some hints that may help you in writing your simlines program:

    Writing that left-justified 20 character filename is easy if you know how to use printf. Look online for hints about printing fixed width left-justified strings or ask for help. If you do this right, all the formatting including correct handling of very long filenames, the proper right justification of the line number, etc. can easily be handled by a single printf.
    If you read carefully you will note that, except for allowing the output groups to be written in any order, the specification determines character by character exactly what your output must be
    Be careful! If you do not exactly match the specification, you will not get credit. Note that formatting errors tend to impact all of your output, and can easily result in failure of multiple tests or even of all tests ... read the specification and check your output carefully!
    There is no additional deduction for Part C if your readaline supports only lines of limited length, as long as your simlines correctly exits when confronted with a long line that it cannot handle. If your simlines does not exit in that way, then simlines will be graded on its handling of long as well as short lines. 

Performance target
Your simlines program should perform well on inputs resulting in at least 10000 match groups with up to hundreds of thousands of lines of input. (Due to limitations in the implementations of Hansons libraries, if you use the data structures we think likely, you may find performance slows dramatically if the number of match groups grows much larger than 10000.) By perform well, we mean completing in under 20 seconds or so on an unloaded server, if the output is redirected to a file or to /dev/null (If you look up /dev/null you'll find that it is a pseudo-file that throws away whatever is written to it... writing to that won't let you check your output, but it's a good way to time your program without waiting for hundreds of thousands of lines of output to be written to your display or even to a real file.) Of course, for shorter inputs of hundreds of lines with tens of matches, your program should respond more or less instantaneously.
Problem analysis and advice
This problem boils down to simple string processing and standard data structures.

    The key to solving the simlines problem is to think very carefully about the data structures you will be creating and about how those data structures will result in a solution. Ask yourself questions like the following. Note that these overlap a lot with the information we ask you to provide us in your Design Document
        What data structure(s) will you create to represent a match group?
        How will you efficiently find out whether a given line from an input file belongs in a match group?
        If it does, what information will you retain about the match?
        For which of these are Hanson's datatype implementations such as List, Table, Set, Sequence, etc. useful, or when is it more appropriate to use C-language arrays, structs, etc.?
        Which data, if any, should be converted to Hanson Atoms, and why?
        When the time comes to write out a match group, how will you write the matches in order? (Hint: you should not try to sort them using a sort routine...there are much easier and more efficient ways if you use the right data structures. Be very careful to check the ordering rules for the various data structures you might be tempted to use!)
        How is the memory for each of your data structures allocated? Do you have a way to free it to avoid memory leaks (remember, there is no way to free the memory for Atoms, and you will not be penalized for using Atoms... all other memory leaks must be avoided.)

    Draw pictures! Take some interesting but small test cases and dry out in detail a picture of all your data structures and how they connect to each other. Once you have this picture absolutely clear and correct, organizing your code and then writing and debugging it will become much easier.
    We've said it before,and you'll hear us say it again and again in COMP 40: you will be tempted to put the majority of your time into designing and coding your program. You'll be tempted to build all or most of it, test the whole thing, and then try to find where the bugs are. This will almost surely waste a lot of your time! When you test all of your work together, the bugs could be almost anywhere. A bug in one routine might not cause an immediate crash, but might produce bad results because your program to fail after executing hundreds of thousands of more lines of code.

    The way to avoid this is to put as much energy into your test plan as you get into the design and and coding of your solution. Find ways to test individual pieces of your code. Create test cases explore not just the obvious paths, but the unusual ones.
    C strings are different from C++ strings, and C's string library can be tricky to use properly. Make absolutely certain you understand the role of the NULL character '\0' in the termination of C strings. If you just code without understanding this, you are in for hours of frustration. Hanson offers some string processing libraries that you may (or might not) find helpful...my solution does not use them, but Norman Ramsey did use them in the solution to a somewhat similar problem given in years past.
    When it comes to string comparison, what you know is wrong. In C, writing

      if (s1 == s2) { ... }

    does not compare equality of two strings—it compares equality of pointers. To compare two strings for equality, you must write

      if (strcmp(s1, s2) == 0) { ... }

    Many old hands write this code more briefly:

      if (!strcmp(s1, s2)) { ... }

    but the briefer style requires a sharp eye for the exclamation mark and is based on a pun: strcmp() returns 0 when the strings match, and an if will regard that as false.

    We prefer to make tests involving integers that don't actually stand for booleans explicit, so use the first form.
    Hanson's Atom interface maps equal strings to identical pointers, so pointer equality is OK on strings created with Atom_string or Atom_new. To use strings as keys or for similar purposes with Hanson's data structures, you must use the Atom interface. (When using a string as a value (as opposed to a key), then use of Atom's is optional.)

    Note: Hansons's Array data structure is not available for use in COMP 40. As you will see in the next assignment, we have developed an improved (or at least more interesting) version that we will introduce then. You should not need to use Hansons's array for this first homework. (Of course, C character strings are C arrays, so you will definitely use C arrays when working with those.)
    Don't forget to run valgrind on your code

Repeat: the data structures are already built for you; your job is to figure out which ones will be useful. We are looking for a clean, straightforward design.
Part C (DESIGN): Simlines Design

DUE EARLY! (see course calendar)
Design overview

The key to doing a good job on any program of significant complexity is to think thoroughly in advance two related questions:

    How will data in the program be represented and interconnected?
    How will the program logic be organized, and how will the computation be done? 

For many programs, the first question is the more fundamental: you will find that if you have a sound and well considered approach to representing the data in your program, the logic and the program structure will easily follow. Thus, the heart of a software design lies in its representation of data.

There are several reasons why it's useful not just to think through, but also to write down the answers to the above questions before writing your program logic. These include:

    Writing down your design will tend to make you think it through more carefully. You will do a better job of discovering whether you have anticipated all the possibilities.
    Once your design is written down, it will be easy for you to have others review it (in the case of COMP 40, you will develop your design with your partner, and you may show it to teaching assistants and instructors, but to no one else)
    In COMP 40, we ask you to submit a design document early enough that we can give you some comments while your program is still under development. Often, we can warn you of design problems before they derail you.

It is crucial to cover not just the obvious main path considerations for your program; you need to consider all the different inputs and circumstances that your program has to handle properly.
Design document specifics

Because documentation is such an essential part of COMP 40, we offer a number detailed guides on the course referenced page. Included are some general guidance to preparing documentation, as well as specific guides for design documents for entire programs and for new abstract data types.

For this assignment, we are making things simpler and asking you only for the following subset of the information we might normally expect for a new program. In the design document you submit you must:

    Identify what data structures you will need to compute simlines and what each data structure will contain
    Hanson's data structures are polymorphic, so you will have to explain what each void * pointer will point to
    Please describe the invariant that will hold when your simlines program is partway through reading input lines.
    Based on these two explanations, explain briefly how you will determine the simlines groups once all input has been read and explain how you will use your match group data structures to write the required output sections .
    Explain in detail your testing plan for both part B and part C You'll get essentially no credit for saying "I plan to try it with lots of inputs and see if it works". We need to know how you plan to test (e.g. readaline is a function, so you'll have to explain who calls it), and you should give us some sense of the range of test cases you'll be trying. 

Suggested order of work

This is a big assignment, and it's your first assignment. You will need to balance working in an orderly way with looking ahead so you can plan your time and overlap thinking about some of the harder problems in Part C with some of the development work for Part A and Part B. As described below, you will need to get far enough on the design of Part C to submit your design document on time.

The exact order in which you will want to do all this will depend a bit on what you already know and on your working style, but something like this will work for most of you:

    Read all of this instruction document several times. Try to make sure you understand what is being asked of you, and if you don't, ask on Piazza or talk to a TA in the labs.
    Make an annotated copy of these instructions that you and your partner can share (either on paper or online), noting things you don't understand, and indicating specific areas that will require research, design work, etc. Note in your annotations everything that you are required to submit, and every specific case that you must cover. We are not asking you to hand in your annotated copy, but you can use it as a valuable checklist as you work through the assignment.
    Make a tentative schedule and update it as things change. You can base it on the following if you like. Plan for trouble! Things will almost surely go wrong. If you aim to have your work done a day or two early, then the pressure will not be so great if you have a nasty bug.
    Your main early activities should include:
        Learning all the technologies you will need to solve these problems so that you can make good design decisions. If necessary, experiment! Almost surely, you will want to write little test programs that open files, read data, and maybe create a Hanson data structure or two, just to make sure you know how. Your annotated instructions will be a good guide to what to learn first (e.g. image file formats and Pnm_rdr for your brightness program)
        Setting up your development environment, as described above
    Then, get started designing Part A: Brightness (remember: both partners must be working together on all aspects of the design and implementation and testing … you must not split the work!)
    Before you implement brightness, make a detailed test plan for it. Include in your schedule the time to develop the test cases and to do the actual testing.
    Start working on the implementation of Part A: Brightness. Try to finish brightness in the first half of the time available for this assignment. Part B and especially Part C are more time-consuming, so leave plenty of time for them!
    As you start to turn the corner on brightness, or if you are getting short on time, begin preparing your design document for Part C: Similarities in files. You probably won't make good progress on your first try, as you'll realize that you need to look more deeply into some of the Hanson interfaces and what they can do for you.
    Make a detailed test plan for Part B (Read a Line) and for .Part C: Similarities in files (we need an outline of both test plans in your design document.)
    Be sure to submit your design document by the deadline (or up to two days late if you are using tokens — if you use tokens for your design document you may not get feedback in time to be useful for your implementation)
    Design, implement and thoroughly test the partial credit version of Part B (Read a Line). Do not rely on your simlines program as the only test framework for readaline.
    With luck, around this time you'll be getting back our comments on your Part C design document. Either way, as soon as you finish Part B, start refine your design for and then code simlines (part C).
    Test, test, and test some more.
    If you have time, go back and extend your readaline to handle long lines. Thoroughly unit test readaline and, only once it works reliably, relink your simlines with it. Before you start modifying readaline to handle long lines, be sure to save a copy of the source for your simple implementation! That way, if you get in trouble with the enhancement you'll still have something that works. Without that, you will have neither a working Part B nor Part C!
    As you get ready to submit, read carefully the section on Organizing and submitting your solutions. 

To review: the design document covers the design of part C only and also testing plans for both part B and part C. Your design document is due before the rest of the assignment. Parts A and B do not require a written design. The full assignment (parts A, B, and C) is due a few days later. Having working versions of all parts with only short line support in Part B will earn you more credit then a full version of Part B but missing or buggy Part C. See the course calendar for specific due dates.
Deadlines and tokens

Like all programming assignments for this class, the programming parts of this assignment are due one minute before midnight on the day indicated in the course calendar. You may turn in assignments up to 48 hours after the due date, which will cost you one or two extension tokens. If you wish not to spend an extension token, then when midnight arrives submit whatever you have. We are very willing to give partial credit.

If you spend an extension token on any part of the assignment, it automatically applies to all parts of the assignment. I.e. submit either your design or your code a day late you use a token; submit them both a day late and it's still only one token total. Of course, if either is two days late, that's two tokens.

You may resubmit until the original deadline (i.e. not counting token extensions) and we will grade the latest version available at the deadline. What you may not do is to submit before the deadline, then decide to use tokens and resubmit. Reason: at the deadline we gather your work and start grading. If you resubmit, we will likely not notice, and would then have to regrade. If you are planning to use tokens, please do not submit. If you have an unusual problem, please email comp40-staff@cs.tufts.edu.
Organizing and submitting your solutions

You will make two submissions to complete this assignment. Several days before the final submission, you will submit a design document. At the end of your work, you will make a final submission that includes your code.

Only one partner makes each submission, and the same partner should submit both the design and the final code submission. When you submit, you will identify your partner.
Submitting your design document

By the design deadline, submit a design document that explains what data structures you will use to write simlines and how you will use them.

Your document should be a plain ASCII document called DESIGN and formatted to fit in 80 columns. If you prefer to use a word processor you can submit design.pdf.

To submit your design, change to the directory that contains the file and run the submit40-filesnpix-design command. For this to work, you will have had to run use comp40 either by hand or in your .cshrc or your .profile.
Before submitting your code

The purpose of these exercises is not just to teach you some tricky programming, it's to familiarize you with certain techniques, technologies, and approaches to programming.

Before submitting, each member of your team should go back and reread the purpose statement for this assignment.

Has each of you you truly achieved these goals? Pair programming is terrific, but you need to stop once in awhile to make sure that every member of your team is getting the experience needed to move ahead. Your next steps in COMP 40 depend on your being solid in these basics. It's a lot to learn in a week: if you're still unsure, talk to a TA or schedule time with the instructor.
Submitting your completed work

In your final submission, don't forget to include a README file which

    Identifies you and your programming partner by name and
    Acknowledges help you may have received from or collaborative work you may have undertaken with classmates, programming partners, course staff, or others
    Identifies what has been correctly implemented and what has not
    Says approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment 

Your final submission should include at least these files:

README
brightness.c
simlines.c

A carefully designed, modular solution for simlines will probably include at least two other files.

When you get everything working, cd into the directory you are submitting and type submit40-filesnpix to submit your work.
General advice for new C programmers

You will find some very helpful introductions to C on the COMP 40 course references page. Some of the primary differences between C and C++ include:

    C has structures but not classes: a C programmer must find good ways to manage together the definition of data structures and the code that manipulates those structures, but C will not make the connection for you.
    I/O in C is different from C++, and generally a somewhat lower level. Although C has a few simple facilities for reading in numbers etc., most of the input and output you do will be at the level of individual characters or bytes. Instead of doing input and output using the <iostream> C++ library with its convenient << operator and the cout and cin streams, you will use the <stdio.h> C library, with its less convenient printf, fgetc and fgets functions, etc. and the stdout and stdin file handles. (In C++, the operators << and >> are overloaded at multiple types, but C does not support operator overloading, so another approach is needed.)
    Don't forget to initialize each C pointer variable, and if necessary, the data to which it points. In C++, an object may be initialized implicitly by a constructor, so a construction like:

        Car *myCar_p = new Car;

    might allocate space for a Car object, initialize all the car member data, and set the myCar_p pointer.

    In C, you should use Hanson's NEW or malloc from the C library to allocate space for your data and to return a pointer:

        struct Car *myCar_p;

        /* Hanson */
        NEW(myCar_p);     /* allocate space for a Car struct and set myCar_p */

        /* C library: one of the following */
        myCar_p = malloc(sizeof(struct Car));  /* obvious but less foolproof */
        myCar_p = malloc(sizeof(*myCar_p));    /* better in most cases       */

    Crucially, none of the C constructions shown above actually initializes members of the Car structure; they just allocate the needed space. You will see in Hanson's book good techniques (e.g. functions like Table_new) for writing code that combines allocation with initialization to achieve roughly what C++ gives you.

    Of course, if you want to avoid memory leaks, you will eventually want to match each Hanson NEW with a FREE, and each malloc with a free. One excellent technique that professionals use is to write the cleanup code at the same time as the allocation code. So, typically, each time you code a malloc you code a matching free somewhere else. Very often the latter will be in the termination code that runs just before your program exits.

    One more detail to keep in mind: C++ and Hanson's library each have support for Exceptions, and those can result when C++ New or Hanson NEW fail to find the needed space. C itself does not have exceptions; if space can't be found then malloc returns NULL. You should always check after each malloc to ensure that it worked!
    You might wish to take three minutes to view, or review, Pointer Fun with Binky, and compare the code you see there with Hanson's NEW macro.
    Use the C programming idioms that we suggest for all good C programs!

Follow the Hanson model for checked runtime errors.  See section 2.4, p. 24ff for information about them, and observe their use in Hanson's code.

COMP 40 — Spring 2016
Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming

Home Calendar Reference Admin Piazza
Course Overview

COMP 40 will give you two important experiences:

    You will turn the corner from introductory programming to programming as a professional
    You will study in detail the structure of modern computers, and that in turn will add greatly to your understanding of how computer hardware, operating systems, compilers, language runtimes and other tools work together to influence the performance of your programs

These two goals are very closely related: all good computer professionals know how to apply deep knowledge of computing systems to their programming projects and to their research in computer science. Whether you are a newly confirmed CS major, someone who is considering a CS major but is unsure, or a student from another field who is interested in a deep look at some of the most important technologies of our time, COMP 40 should give you an intense, realistic and (we hope!) exciting look at how modern computers work.

For more information about the course see the about COMP 40 page, which includes a section on prerequisites.
Schedule

Lectures: Mondays/Wednesdays 3:00 – 4:15 PM in Anderson 206 and 208.
Labs: Friday 10:30 - 11:45 AM or 1:30 - 2:45 PM (Halligan 116 & 118 with overflow in 120)

Attendance at lectures and labs is mandatory. You are responsible for anything that is said in class or lab, including changes to homework assignments, in-class exercises, and useful information not documented elsewhere.

Note for spring 2016: Lectures are held in two separate rooms for the spring of 2016. If we are lucky, we will move into a larger room. I will be in Anderson 206 and we will use WebEx and the facilities in the two rooms to stream slides and drawings and audio into 208 and audio back from 208 to 206 (so students can ask questions).

Please be patient, and we'll try to work out how we can use the system most effectively.

We will randomly assign students to classrooms on a per-lecture basis so students who come further across campus don't get systematically locked out of 206.
Staff

The instructor for the course is Professor Mark Sheldon. Contact information, office hours, etc. are available from Mark's Home Page.

Our graduate teaching assistants are Carter Casey, Behnam Heydarshahi, Evana Gizzi, Sana Farrukh, and Jake Crawford. We also have numerous undergraduate teaching assistants who will hold office hours in the Halligan computing labs. Schedules for the undergraduate assistants will be posted and updated in Piazza.
Getting Help
COMP 40 covers a wide range of complex material. Even top students typically will need help regularly to learn the material and complete assignments. Details on various resources available to you are described on the course administration page.

For most technical questions please use Piazza! The professor and TAs monitor Piazza continually, and will attempt to answer your question promptly. Other students will benefit from seeing both your question and the answer and indeed in many cases, other students will answer your question before we do. For individual questions about grades, etc. the e-mail address comp40-staff@cs.tufts.edu will reach your instructor and all graduate teaching assistants. See the instructions for using Piazza on the course administration page.
Policies and procedures all students are required to know

All students are expected to understand and obey all of the rules and policies outlined on the course policies and administration page. These include especially the principles of academic integrity and the course policy on collaboration.

The same page also provides important information about course grading policies, homework, etc. Use the Piazza forum. You may also use other on-line sources, but when you do, you must observe the principles of academic integrity and the course policy on collaboration.
Feedback

Your candid comments on any aspect of the course are always welcome. For ideas you want to share with the rest of the COMP 40 community, please post in Piazza. Thanks to Chloe Lopez, you can also send an anonymous comment directly to your instructor. Click on the link which will get you a form on which you can submit your comment.

COMP 40 in its current form was originally created and taught by Prof. Norman Ramsey. Since then the course has been taught and adapted by Noah Daniels, Mark Sheldon, and Noah Mendelsohn. Much of the written course material and almost all of the programming assignments have been carried over or adapted from earlier work. Credit for the best of it goes to them; responsibility for any problems lies with the current instructor.

Pair programming: What to do when you're not holding the keyboard
In pair programming, usually only one person can type at a time. Here are some suggestions for the other person:

    If you have a spare USB keyboard, plug it in and keep it handy. That way you can switch with your partner without passing the keyboard (a procedure I have always found awkward).
    If you're not holding a keyboard, hold a pencil and a piece of paper.
    Keep your lips moving. If you understand what's going on, keep up a running commentary. If you don't understand what's going on, ask questions. 

So much for general advice. Here are some things you should do, especially if you're holding pencil and paper:

    If you're debugging and your partner is changing code, make a note of other parts of the program (in the same module or in other modules) that will have to be changed. For example, if your program does arithmetic, and you decide the math is wrong, if your partner is replacing ``old math'' with ``new math'', make a note of all the other places you'll have to inspect for ``old math.''
    If your partner is working the definition of a data structure, draw a picture of it.
    If your partner is writing down a struct definition, insist on a short same-line comment documenting each field.
    If your partner is working on an an algorithm, draw pictures of any relevant data structures.
    If your partner is writing new code, or revisiting old code that doesn't work, write down how to test it.

What is a script?

In computing, the term script refers to a program that invokes and coordinates the activities of other programs. An application build script is one that invokes compilers, linkers and other tools to compile and link your executable application. As we will see, some build tools are smart enough to understand which pieces of code depend on which others (e.g. which .c files include .h files) and to only recompile what's necessary when small changes are made.
Why use scripts to build your programs?

When you started programming in C++ or in C you probably learned to build your programs this way:

g++ -o myprog myprog.cpp

or

gcc -o myprog myprog.c

These commands use the Gnu compiler to compile a single source file into a runnable Linux executable. Directly calling the compiler this way is perfectly acceptable for simple programs but as you start building more complex programs a number of problems become obvious:

    Most large programs are built from multiple source files. Although it's often possible to name all of these on the command line, doing that is inconvenient.
    You will likely need to set a number of options on the g++ or gcc command line to override compiler defaults, to indicate which directories are to be searched for include files, etc., and you'll have to type those options correctly each time you recompile.
    If your program is big and has lots of source files, recompiling all the pieces each time you make a small change is wasteful.
    You may wish to build several different programs that share some common pieces; in such cases, it's very useful to have a tool that automatically rebuilds everything when shared pieces change.

Application build scripts automate the process of building an application or other program and they can also automate related tasks such as running tests. Build scripts make it much easier to rebuild your program, and that in turn should encourage you to recompile and test frequently as you create your program. Build scripts also help other programmers learn how to recompile and link your code.

In COMP 40, we rely on compile scripts with a known interface to build your homework submissions. That is, when you submit your program you will include a build script, and it must be invokable in just the way we specify. Typically we require a shell script named compile which, when run with no arguments, builds all the code and applications we've asked you to submit. Our test scripts depend on that compile script to build your code for testing. (Some assignments may ask for compile scripts in other forms, such as using a makefile, as described below).
What tools can you use to build your scripts?

In principle, any programming language or tool that can invoke other command line programs can be used to create application build scripts. These include general purpose scripting languages such as Python, PERL and Ruby; shell languages like sh, bash, csh and ksh; and tools like make, mk, ant, raven, maven, etc. that are designed specifically for creating application build scripts. Of these many choices, there are two (or maybe three) that you should know about for COMP 40:

    Shell languages (e.g. sh)

    When you are typing on the console of your Unix login session you are talking to a program known as a shell. This is a program that reads what you type, does some work like expanding filename wildcards, and then invokes the programs you've asked to run. In fact, the shell languages are themselves small prorgramming lanuages; although you usually type one command at a time, you can actually use them to write little loops, if statements, etc. right from the console. The same shell command processors can be used to run shell programs stored in files, but the situation is confused somewhat by the fact that over the years a number of competing shells have been built, each with its own language.

    Regardless of the shell you're running to interpret your console commands, the tradition in COMP 40 is to write compile scripts using the /bin/sh shell language. A section below provides hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh.
    make

    make is the most famous application build language. Although make is somewhat clumsy and ad-hoc in its syntax, it's very powerful and very widely used. If only for that reason, every good programmer should learn to use make.

    The key feature of make and of many other languages designed specifically for building applications is that it allows you to state which pieces of your program depend on which others. When you run make it checks the dates on all your files to determine what's been changed since the last time you built your application, and it rebuilds only files that depend, directly or indirectly, on changed files. You tell make how to do each step in the build process, e.g. how to build multiply.o from multiply.c, and make invokes only the steps that are needed.

    The rules for building each program or application are placed into a file known as a makefile. When you invoke make you can supply the name of the makefile to use:

                 make -f mymakefile myprog
        

    ...will use the makefile named mymakefile to build the program named myprog. If no makefile is named, make will try to find makefile or Makefile (in that order). The following will build myprog using one of those two makefiles.

                 make myprog
        

    When code is distributed for public use it's very common to find a makefile or Makefile along with the code. This is usually a signal that make is the tool to use for building that program.
    mk

    Even Stu Feldman, who many years ago created make, has acknowledged its problems. Among the tools he recommends as an alternative is mk (pronounced "muck"), which was created to support the experimental Plan 9 operating system at Bell Labs.

    The syntax of mk is arguably cleaner and easier to learn than that of make and mk has some powerful features that may be useful when you are building truly complex systems. Norman Ramsey gives a spirited defense of mk in How to Write Compile Scripts.

We may in some cases provide you with tools that are built with make or mk, and you are strongly advised to learn at least the basics of make. It's a skill that will serve you well in your career and one that potential employers may value. Some Hints for writing makefiles are also provided below.

mk is not nearly as widely used as the other tools discussed here but it's got a cleaner design than make and it also is the language we've used behind the scenes to build many of the COMP 40 course materials. You may occasionally see scripts with names like somescript.mk; that .mk suffix likely means that mk is the language being used.
Using build scripts for testing and packaging

Consider using make or other similar tools to integrate testing and packaging with the build process. For example, you might have a make target that does unit testing:

             make test-results

Write your makefile so that the target test-results depends on the executable program(s) being tested. Now if you change some source files and run the above command, make will automatically rebuild your application and immediately run tests on it. That can be a wonderful way to be sure that none of the changes you've made has broken anything that had been working. We strongly encourage you to build your test cases early in the development process and to retest your code after every significant change to the source.

In the same spirit, build targets can be used to invoke tools like valgrind:

             make valgrind-tests

You should have this target depend on an up-to-date build of your system, and then have it run one or more tests of your code using valgrind. Doing this will likely encourage you to run valgrind often, and to be sure that your code is up-to-date when you do.

If you're creating a system that will be distributed to others then a build target to create distribution packages can be very useful:

             make distribution

This would (if necessary) recompile and relink any code that's to be distributed to users in object form and then package the code, perhaps into a tar file, a zip file, or some other form that's convenient for distributing to others.

Of course, all these things can be done equally well with mk or with shell scripts.
Hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh

Here are some hints that may be useful for writing and understanding compile scripts in sh:
Finding documentation on sh

The first place to look for documentation on sh is in the man pages:

man sh

Sometimes doing this gives you the man page for an implementation called bash and indeed on our Tufts CS systems /bin/sh is just a link to /bin/bash; bash has some extensions, but for most of what you'll doing doing sh and bash are compatible. So, either man page is good enough for COMP 40 purposes. In any case, the man pages document the complete syntax of the language and give some instructions for using it. There are also lots of sh and bash tutorials on the Web.
Filename globbing

As we've seen, sh (like bash, csh, tcsh, ksh, etc.) is a language that's designed to interpret commands at an interactive command prompt. One of the services it provides is globbing, in which strings containing characters like * are replaced with a list of filenames matching the expression:

   ls mult*.c    # all files starting with "mult" and ending with .c
   cat [ab]*     # all files starting with "a" or "b"

This is done by replacing the expressions with lists of filenames that become the arguments to commands. So, the second line above might actually turn into the command:

   cat albert anthony.c bertha birtday.html bigdeal.cpp

...if those files happened to be in the current directory. Because sh runs your commands the same way when they come from a script file as from the console, the same globbing is done on every command in your scripts!
Arguments to the script

Your compile script is itself a program that will be invoked (most likely) from the command line. So, your script can be given arguments.

compile -link fgroups

has two arguments: -link and fgroups. You will often see within the compile script code that accesses these parameters. For example:

echo $2

would call the echo command, passing it the second parameter (fgroups for the command above). You can also find out how many parameters there are:

echo $#

echos the number "2", because the script was passed two parameters. You can also work with all the parameters together. If the number of arguments is nargs then:

echo $@    

...is the same as:

echo $1 $2 ... $nargs   

Surprisingly, it's also possible to update the argument list. For example:

shift
echo $@

This would echo only "fgroups", because the shift command shifts all the arguments to the left, and thus "loses" the "-unlink" argument. Such shifting is very commonly done to eliminate arguments such as switches after they have been processed by the script.

set *.c

Somewhat confusingly, the set command completely replaces the command line arguments! After the above command, the original arguments (-link fgroups) are gone, replaced with a list of all .c files. Specifically, globbing is done on *.c, so the set command is given a list of all .c files in the current directory. The set command then sets the argument list to that list of files.

One of the reasons scripts update the argument list is that some important internal script commands default to operating on the argument list:

for cfile 
do
  gcc -c $cfile
done

There are at least two important things to learn from the above example: the for loop iterates over the arguments in $@ (which, after the earlier set command is a list of all the user's .c files). Also, shell scripts have named variables that can be substituted into commands using the $variable_name syntax. So, the above command loops through all the files named in the argument list and calls gcc on each one.

It's also common to set variable names using the = operator. These lines of code are taken from a COMP 40 build script:

CC=gcc

CFLAGS="-I. -I/comp/40/include $CIIFLAGS"
FLAGS="-g -O -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -std=c99 -pedantic"

for cfile 
do
  $CC $FLAGS $CFLAGS -c $cfile
done

You should now be more or less able to understand what commands are executed by that code.
Back quotes

One thing missing from the above is the assignment to $CIIFLAGS. In the actual script, that turns out to use a feature you haven't seen:

CIIFLAGS=`pkg-config --cflags cii40`

Note carefully the backquotes ` surrounding the pkg-config command on the right. Also note that pkg-config has nothing to do with the shell language itself: it's an ordinary command just like gcc, cat or ls.

When a command in a script is in backquotes, the command is run and the output of the command is substituted in place of the quoted command text. So, in this example, the pkg-config command is run with the arguments --cflags cii40; the output of that pkg-config command is assigned to the shell variable CIIFLAGS. (To learn what pkg-config does, try man pkg-config, or else you can just guess that it probably figures out some switches we'll want to pass to the compiler when building something to do with "cii40"...which turns out to be the package name for the Hanson code we use in COMP 40!)
Conditionals

sh has if statements, for loops and many other features of traditional imperative programming languages. You'll need to check the man page for details, but you'll often be able to guess from the syntax what these constructs are doing. One feature for which sh uses a somewhat unusual syntax is conditionals like these::

if [ $linked = no ]; then
  # do something here if variable linked is equal to "no"
fi 

An expression in square brackets is called a conditional, and it evaluates to a boolean true or false. As you can see from the example above, string literals like no need not be quoted unless they contain spaces; variable references must begin with a dollar sign $.

Although the expression in brackets may look like part of the if statement syntax, it's not; the same conditional syntax can be used elsewhere, for example:

[ -n "$2" ] || { echo "You need a second argument to this script" >&2; exit 1; }

Note that the above is of the form: a || b. The expression a, which is the conditional [-n "$2"] is evaluated; if it's false, then expression b on the right is evaluated. That happens to be a compound statement of the form: {stmt1; stmt2;}.

The key to understanding the above example is that [ -n "$2"] is a conditional that tests the length of a string to ensure it's not empty. So, this example writes an error message to standard error only if there is no second argument to the script.

Many conditionals test the existence or nature of named files. for example:


[-e "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists
[-f "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists and is a file (not dir, etc)
[-d "/tmp/somedir"]     # True if /tmp/somedir is a directory

There are many, many other useful conditionals. See the man page for details.
A realistic example

You don't have to understand all of the above in detail on day 1 of COMP 40 but you should rapidly develop an intuition about which parts of each compile script are doing what. That way you will be able to make small modifications to the scripts and to debug them when they break.

Now, take a look at the compile script for a recent version of COMP 40 HW assignments 1; with luck, you'll be able to understand most of what it's doing (several of the fragments above are taken from that script).
The shebang #! convention

This is a good time to learn a Unix scripting techinque that's illustrated on the first line of the sample compile script, which says:

#!/bin/sh

It starts with a #, so the script processor considers it a comment, but it serves a very specific purpose. There are actually two ways you could run this script:

    sh compile -link fgroups: when you do it this way, that first line doesn't matter. You're telling the system to invoke the sh shell and your giving it the name of the script to execute. Whoever does this needs to know that it's an sh script.
    ./compile -link fgroups: done this way, we're treating the script itself as an executable command, but how does Unix know whether to run this using sh (or maybe Python or csh?). That's what that first "shebang" line is for: when you invoke a command that appears to be a text file, Unix (or Linux) looks at the first line. If it starts with:

    #!...some executable name here

    Then the named executable (in our case sh) is run and passed the file as a first argument!

So, we've been able to use our script as if it was a new command named compile (assuming that's the filename of the script). There is one more detail: for this to work you'll need to give your file execute permissions. A likely way to do that is:

chmod u+x compile

which uses the chmod Unix command to indicate that the user (that's the u) who owns the file is to have execute (x) permissions. Of course, you should see man chmod for more information on setting the permission mode.

Oh, and why is it called the "shebang" convention? The "#" character is the "sharp sign" or "hash" (or "number sign"), and the "!" character programmers call "bang". So, shebang. You'll often hear a programmer who's reading a string to another programmer pronounce it in this style: "hash bang slash bin slash usr", etc.

(By the way, if you're not bored yet, you'll surely want to know that the etyomology of the word shebang is surprisingly varied and ambiguous...and if that's not sufficiently obscure detail, the # sign is also known as the octothorpe!)
Hints for writing makefiles

There are many make tutorials and sample makefiles available on the Web. Of course, you should also do man make, and also consult the extensive reference manual for GNU Make (do try to avoid using GNU extensions unless needed). Here we give a short introduction to what make can do.
Tabs and spaces

One important warning about make: tabs and spaces aren't interchangeable!. When you see a rule like this in a makefile:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -o brightness brightness.c

there is a tab character (not spaces!) ahead of the command "gcc" on the second line. If your editor has a feature that replaces tabs with spaces, you'll have to turn that off when editing makefiles! (This is just an example of why people complain about make. Still, it's a very powerful tool that can do very useful things for you.)
Variables

Like shell scripts, makefiles allow you to set and substitute named variables:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: $(EXECUTABLES)

is more or less equivalent to:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: brightness fgroups

Targets and Dependencies

Consider again that same fragment:

all: brightness fgroups

This tells make that if the user says:

make all

...then it's necessary to ensure that fgroups and brightness are up to date. We say that the target all depends on fgroups and brightness. But how can the make system know whether those program(s) actually need to be rebuilt? Somewhere in the makefile should be another rule telling what those two programs depend on, and how to build them. A very simple rule might be:

brightness: brightness.o
    gcc -o brightness brightness.o 

which says to build brightness by linking brightness.o. Note that each rule starts with a target name in the left margin, followed by a colon, and optionally followed by any dependencies. If there are one or more commands needed to build the target, they are listed below, with tabs starting each such line.

Of course, we then need a rule for being sure that brightness.o is up to date, and telling us how to build that:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -c brightness.c

So, what happens if we issue the command "make brightness"? Make starts by building a tree of dependencies. What do we need to build brightness? Answer: an up-to-date brightness.o. What do we need to build that? There's another rule that tells us, and so on. After building the whole tree of dependencies the system will decide that the first check to be made is whether brightness.c been changed since brightness.o was last built. and if so that code will be recompiled. Then, if the brightness exectuable is older than the (possibly recompiled) brightness.o, the executable is relinked. In short, only necessary work is done.

Note that, unlike a script, a makefile is not a list of steps to be performed in order; it's a set of rules, and each rule is considered as needed according to the circumstance. Rules are chosen by pattern matching on filenames and by checking whether any dependencies must be rebuilt. Once a rule is chosen, there may indeed be one or more steps (actually zero or more) specified to build the target.
Pattern rules and automatic variables

Make has many many other sophisticated features, but there's one more you should learn early. Consider this fragment:

# 
#    To get any .o, compile the corresponding .c
#
%.o:%.c 
    gcc $(FLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

Our first approach required a separate rule for each .o, but all of those rules look almost the same. The fragment above uses what make calls pattern rules (e.g. %.c) and automatic variables (e.g. $<). You'll have to read the GNU make documentation for all the details, but what the fragment above says is:

    Every .o file depends on the corresponding .c file
    The name of that .c file is substituted into the gcc command after the -c option

So, a single rule suffices to build a .o file from any corresponding .c file. Also shown in the gcc command line is the substitution of two variables FLAGS and CFLAGS that we can assume have been set with the compiler options that we're using on this project. We can thus ensure that the same compiler options are automatically applied to each compilation. Obviously we can (and should) do something similar on the commands that link the executables.
A realistic example

Appendix II contains a makefile that builds HW assignments 1. With the hints given above you should be able to figure out most of what it's doing.

Right now, the COMP 40 homework submission process expects a compile script not a makefile; you should be sure to provide a working compile script or else your homework may not be graded. Still it's good to know how makefiles work, and we may sometime soon switch to using them for some assignments.
Build scripts as documentation

Like any other code you write, your build scripts and makefiles should be designed as documentation to be read by other programmers. Especially if you use languages like make or mk, your build scripts formally document which pieces of your system depend on which others. Of course, your scripts also document the compiler switches and other settings used.

Make sure your build scripts are cleanly structured and easy to read. When it's not obvious from the code, include comments explaining what various build targets do, and any other information that might be needed by someone maintaining or modifying your code. Be especially careful to document non-obvious dependencies on tools or libraries, e.g.:

# This build runs against the grapics library 
# version 2.8, which is current as of July, 2013.  The 
# program depends on features such as double buffering
# introduced in v2.8.  
# NEEDSWORK We should add an automatic configuration 
# test to ensure double buffering is available.

APPENDIX I: A COMP 40 Compile Script

This is the compile script for a recent version of COMP 40 HW 1. That assignment requires the development of two executables, named brightness and fgroups

APPENDIX II: A COMP 40 Makefile

The following makefile is more or less equivalent to the compile script shown above in Appendex I. Like that script, this makefile defaults to building the brightness and fgroups executables. So, if we assume this file is called Makefile, here are some commands we could issue:

make all          # builds fgroups and brightness and any needed .o files
make              # same as "make all" because all is the default target
make brightness   # builds brightness, and any .o files that needs
make fgroups.o    # recompiles fgroups.o only if fgroups.c is changed
make clean        # remove all .o files and executables fgroups and brightness

Here is the sample makefile:

#            Makefile for COMP 40 Homework 1
#
#     Author: Noah Mendelsohn (adapted from Norman Ramsey's compile script)
#
#  Maintenance targets:
#
#
#    all         - (default target) make sure everything's compiled
#    clean       - clean out all compiled object and executable files
#    brightness  - compile just the brightness program
#    fgroups     - compile just the fingerprint group program.
#
#

# Executables to built using "make all"

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

#
#  The following is a compromise. You MUST list all your .h files here.
#  If any .h file changes, all .c files will be recompiled. To do better,
#  we could make an explicit target for each .o, naming only the .h
#  files it really uses.
#
# Add your own .h files to the right side of the assingment below.

LIBS = $(CIILIBS) -lm    
LFLAGS = -L$(COMP40)/lib64

# these flags max out warnings and debug info
FLAGS = -g -O -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -std=c99 -pedantic

# 
#    'make all' will build all executables
#
#    Note that "all" is the default target that make will build
#    if nothing is specifically requested
#
all: $(EXECUTABLES)

# 
#    'make clean' will remove all object and executable files
#
clean:
    rm -f $(EXECUTABLES) *.o


# 
#    To get any .o, compile the corresponding .c
#

What is a script?

In computing, the term script refers to a program that invokes and coordinates the activities of other programs. An application build script is one that invokes compilers, linkers and other tools to compile and link your executable application. As we will see, some build tools are smart enough to understand which pieces of code depend on which others (e.g. which .c files include .h files) and to only recompile what's necessary when small changes are made.
Why use scripts to build your programs?

When you started programming in C++ or in C you probably learned to build your programs this way:

g++ -o myprog myprog.cpp

or

gcc -o myprog myprog.c

These commands use the Gnu compiler to compile a single source file into a runnable Linux executable. Directly calling the compiler this way is perfectly acceptable for simple programs but as you start building more complex programs a number of problems become obvious:

    Most large programs are built from multiple source files. Although it's often possible to name all of these on the command line, doing that is inconvenient.
    You will likely need to set a number of options on the g++ or gcc command line to override compiler defaults, to indicate which directories are to be searched for include files, etc., and you'll have to type those options correctly each time you recompile.
    If your program is big and has lots of source files, recompiling all the pieces each time you make a small change is wasteful.
    You may wish to build several different programs that share some common pieces; in such cases, it's very useful to have a tool that automatically rebuilds everything when shared pieces change.

Application build scripts automate the process of building an application or other program and they can also automate related tasks such as running tests. Build scripts make it much easier to rebuild your program, and that in turn should encourage you to recompile and test frequently as you create your program. Build scripts also help other programmers learn how to recompile and link your code.

In COMP 40, we rely on compile scripts with a known interface to build your homework submissions. That is, when you submit your program you will include a build script, and it must be invokable in just the way we specify. Typically we require a shell script named compile which, when run with no arguments, builds all the code and applications we've asked you to submit. Our test scripts depend on that compile script to build your code for testing. (Some assignments may ask for compile scripts in other forms, such as using a makefile, as described below).
What tools can you use to build your scripts?

In principle, any programming language or tool that can invoke other command line programs can be used to create application build scripts. These include general purpose scripting languages such as Python, PERL and Ruby; shell languages like sh, bash, csh and ksh; and tools like make, mk, ant, raven, maven, etc. that are designed specifically for creating application build scripts. Of these many choices, there are two (or maybe three) that you should know about for COMP 40:

    Shell languages (e.g. sh)

    When you are typing on the console of your Unix login session you are talking to a program known as a shell. This is a program that reads what you type, does some work like expanding filename wildcards, and then invokes the programs you've asked to run. In fact, the shell languages are themselves small prorgramming lanuages; although you usually type one command at a time, you can actually use them to write little loops, if statements, etc. right from the console. The same shell command processors can be used to run shell programs stored in files, but the situation is confused somewhat by the fact that over the years a number of competing shells have been built, each with its own language.

    Regardless of the shell you're running to interpret your console commands, the tradition in COMP 40 is to write compile scripts using the /bin/sh shell language. A section below provides hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh.
    make

    make is the most famous application build language. Although make is somewhat clumsy and ad-hoc in its syntax, it's very powerful and very widely used. If only for that reason, every good programmer should learn to use make.

    The key feature of make and of many other languages designed specifically for building applications is that it allows you to state which pieces of your program depend on which others. When you run make it checks the dates on all your files to determine what's been changed since the last time you built your application, and it rebuilds only files that depend, directly or indirectly, on changed files. You tell make how to do each step in the build process, e.g. how to build multiply.o from multiply.c, and make invokes only the steps that are needed.

    The rules for building each program or application are placed into a file known as a makefile. When you invoke make you can supply the name of the makefile to use:

                 make -f mymakefile myprog
        

    ...will use the makefile named mymakefile to build the program named myprog. If no makefile is named, make will try to find makefile or Makefile (in that order). The following will build myprog using one of those two makefiles.

                 make myprog
        

    When code is distributed for public use it's very common to find a makefile or Makefile along with the code. This is usually a signal that make is the tool to use for building that program.
    mk

    Even Stu Feldman, who many years ago created make, has acknowledged its problems. Among the tools he recommends as an alternative is mk (pronounced "muck"), which was created to support the experimental Plan 9 operating system at Bell Labs.

    The syntax of mk is arguably cleaner and easier to learn than that of make and mk has some powerful features that may be useful when you are building truly complex systems. Norman Ramsey gives a spirited defense of mk in How to Write Compile Scripts.

We may in some cases provide you with tools that are built with make or mk, and you are strongly advised to learn at least the basics of make. It's a skill that will serve you well in your career and one that potential employers may value. Some Hints for writing makefiles are also provided below.

mk is not nearly as widely used as the other tools discussed here but it's got a cleaner design than make and it also is the language we've used behind the scenes to build many of the COMP 40 course materials. You may occasionally see scripts with names like somescript.mk; that .mk suffix likely means that mk is the language being used.
Using build scripts for testing and packaging

Consider using make or other similar tools to integrate testing and packaging with the build process. For example, you might have a make target that does unit testing:

             make test-results

Write your makefile so that the target test-results depends on the executable program(s) being tested. Now if you change some source files and run the above command, make will automatically rebuild your application and immediately run tests on it. That can be a wonderful way to be sure that none of the changes you've made has broken anything that had been working. We strongly encourage you to build your test cases early in the development process and to retest your code after every significant change to the source.

In the same spirit, build targets can be used to invoke tools like valgrind:

             make valgrind-tests

You should have this target depend on an up-to-date build of your system, and then have it run one or more tests of your code using valgrind. Doing this will likely encourage you to run valgrind often, and to be sure that your code is up-to-date when you do.

If you're creating a system that will be distributed to others then a build target to create distribution packages can be very useful:

             make distribution

This would (if necessary) recompile and relink any code that's to be distributed to users in object form and then package the code, perhaps into a tar file, a zip file, or some other form that's convenient for distributing to others.

Of course, all these things can be done equally well with mk or with shell scripts.
Hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh

Here are some hints that may be useful for writing and understanding compile scripts in sh:
Finding documentation on sh

The first place to look for documentation on sh is in the man pages:

man sh

Sometimes doing this gives you the man page for an implementation called bash and indeed on our Tufts CS systems /bin/sh is just a link to /bin/bash; bash has some extensions, but for most of what you'll doing doing sh and bash are compatible. So, either man page is good enough for COMP 40 purposes. In any case, the man pages document the complete syntax of the language and give some instructions for using it. There are also lots of sh and bash tutorials on the Web.
Filename globbing

As we've seen, sh (like bash, csh, tcsh, ksh, etc.) is a language that's designed to interpret commands at an interactive command prompt. One of the services it provides is globbing, in which strings containing characters like * are replaced with a list of filenames matching the expression:

   ls mult*.c    # all files starting with "mult" and ending with .c
   cat [ab]*     # all files starting with "a" or "b"

This is done by replacing the expressions with lists of filenames that become the arguments to commands. So, the second line above might actually turn into the command:

   cat albert anthony.c bertha birtday.html bigdeal.cpp

...if those files happened to be in the current directory. Because sh runs your commands the same way when they come from a script file as from the console, the same globbing is done on every command in your scripts!
Arguments to the script

Your compile script is itself a program that will be invoked (most likely) from the command line. So, your script can be given arguments.

compile -link fgroups

has two arguments: -link and fgroups. You will often see within the compile script code that accesses these parameters. For example:

echo $2

would call the echo command, passing it the second parameter (fgroups for the command above). You can also find out how many parameters there are:

echo $#

echos the number "2", because the script was passed two parameters. You can also work with all the parameters together. If the number of arguments is nargs then:

echo $@    

...is the same as:

echo $1 $2 ... $nargs   

Surprisingly, it's also possible to update the argument list. For example:

shift
echo $@

This would echo only "fgroups", because the shift command shifts all the arguments to the left, and thus "loses" the "-unlink" argument. Such shifting is very commonly done to eliminate arguments such as switches after they have been processed by the script.

set *.c

Somewhat confusingly, the set command completely replaces the command line arguments! After the above command, the original arguments (-link fgroups) are gone, replaced with a list of all .c files. Specifically, globbing is done on *.c, so the set command is given a list of all .c files in the current directory. The set command then sets the argument list to that list of files.

One of the reasons scripts update the argument list is that some important internal script commands default to operating on the argument list:

for cfile 
do
  gcc -c $cfile
done

There are at least two important things to learn from the above example: the for loop iterates over the arguments in $@ (which, after the earlier set command is a list of all the user's .c files). Also, shell scripts have named variables that can be substituted into commands using the $variable_name syntax. So, the above command loops through all the files named in the argument list and calls gcc on each one.

It's also common to set variable names using the = operator. These lines of code are taken from a COMP 40 build script:

CC=gcc

CFLAGS="-I. -I/comp/40/include $CIIFLAGS"
FLAGS="-g -O -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -std=c99 -pedantic"

for cfile 
do
  $CC $FLAGS $CFLAGS -c $cfile
done

You should now be more or less able to understand what commands are executed by that code.
Back quotes

One thing missing from the above is the assignment to $CIIFLAGS. In the actual script, that turns out to use a feature you haven't seen:

CIIFLAGS=`pkg-config --cflags cii40`

Note carefully the backquotes ` surrounding the pkg-config command on the right. Also note that pkg-config has nothing to do with the shell language itself: it's an ordinary command just like gcc, cat or ls.

When a command in a script is in backquotes, the command is run and the output of the command is substituted in place of the quoted command text. So, in this example, the pkg-config command is run with the arguments --cflags cii40; the output of that pkg-config command is assigned to the shell variable CIIFLAGS. (To learn what pkg-config does, try man pkg-config, or else you can just guess that it probably figures out some switches we'll want to pass to the compiler when building something to do with "cii40"...which turns out to be the package name for the Hanson code we use in COMP 40!)
Conditionals

sh has if statements, for loops and many other features of traditional imperative programming languages. You'll need to check the man page for details, but you'll often be able to guess from the syntax what these constructs are doing. One feature for which sh uses a somewhat unusual syntax is conditionals like these::

if [ $linked = no ]; then
  # do something here if variable linked is equal to "no"
fi 

An expression in square brackets is called a conditional, and it evaluates to a boolean true or false. As you can see from the example above, string literals like no need not be quoted unless they contain spaces; variable references must begin with a dollar sign $.

Although the expression in brackets may look like part of the if statement syntax, it's not; the same conditional syntax can be used elsewhere, for example:

[ -n "$2" ] || { echo "You need a second argument to this script" >&2; exit 1; }

Note that the above is of the form: a || b. The expression a, which is the conditional [-n "$2"] is evaluated; if it's false, then expression b on the right is evaluated. That happens to be a compound statement of the form: {stmt1; stmt2;}.

The key to understanding the above example is that [ -n "$2"] is a conditional that tests the length of a string to ensure it's not empty. So, this example writes an error message to standard error only if there is no second argument to the script.

Many conditionals test the existence or nature of named files. for example:


[-e "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists
[-f "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists and is a file (not dir, etc)
[-d "/tmp/somedir"]     # True if /tmp/somedir is a directory

There are many, many other useful conditionals. See the man page for details.
A realistic example

You don't have to understand all of the above in detail on day 1 of COMP 40 but you should rapidly develop an intuition about which parts of each compile script are doing what. That way you will be able to make small modifications to the scripts and to debug them when they break.

Now, take a look at the compile script for a recent version of COMP 40 HW assignments 1; with luck, you'll be able to understand most of what it's doing (several of the fragments above are taken from that script).
The shebang #! convention

This is a good time to learn a Unix scripting techinque that's illustrated on the first line of the sample compile script, which says:

#!/bin/sh

It starts with a #, so the script processor considers it a comment, but it serves a very specific purpose. There are actually two ways you could run this script:

    sh compile -link fgroups: when you do it this way, that first line doesn't matter. You're telling the system to invoke the sh shell and your giving it the name of the script to execute. Whoever does this needs to know that it's an sh script.
    ./compile -link fgroups: done this way, we're treating the script itself as an executable command, but how does Unix know whether to run this using sh (or maybe Python or csh?). That's what that first "shebang" line is for: when you invoke a command that appears to be a text file, Unix (or Linux) looks at the first line. If it starts with:

    #!...some executable name here

    Then the named executable (in our case sh) is run and passed the file as a first argument!

So, we've been able to use our script as if it was a new command named compile (assuming that's the filename of the script). There is one more detail: for this to work you'll need to give your file execute permissions. A likely way to do that is:

chmod u+x compile

which uses the chmod Unix command to indicate that the user (that's the u) who owns the file is to have execute (x) permissions. Of course, you should see man chmod for more information on setting the permission mode.

Oh, and why is it called the "shebang" convention? The "#" character is the "sharp sign" or "hash" (or "number sign"), and the "!" character programmers call "bang". So, shebang. You'll often hear a programmer who's reading a string to another programmer pronounce it in this style: "hash bang slash bin slash usr", etc.

(By the way, if you're not bored yet, you'll surely want to know that the etyomology of the word shebang is surprisingly varied and ambiguous...and if that's not sufficiently obscure detail, the # sign is also known as the octothorpe!)
Hints for writing makefiles

There are many make tutorials and sample makefiles available on the Web. Of course, you should also do man make, and also consult the extensive reference manual for GNU Make (do try to avoid using GNU extensions unless needed). Here we give a short introduction to what make can do.
Tabs and spaces

One important warning about make: tabs and spaces aren't interchangeable!. When you see a rule like this in a makefile:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -o brightness brightness.c

there is a tab character (not spaces!) ahead of the command "gcc" on the second line. If your editor has a feature that replaces tabs with spaces, you'll have to turn that off when editing makefiles! (This is just an example of why people complain about make. Still, it's a very powerful tool that can do very useful things for you.)
Variables

Like shell scripts, makefiles allow you to set and substitute named variables:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: $(EXECUTABLES)

is more or less equivalent to:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: brightness fgroups

Targets and Dependencies

Consider again that same fragment:

all: brightness fgroups

This tells make that if the user says:

make all

...then it's necessary to ensure that fgroups and brightness are up to date. We say that the target all depends on fgroups and brightness. But how can the make system know whether those program(s) actually need to be rebuilt? Somewhere in the makefile should be another rule telling what those two programs depend on, and how to build them. A very simple rule might be:

brightness: brightness.o
    gcc -o brightness brightness.o 

which says to build brightness by linking brightness.o. Note that each rule starts with a target name in the left margin, followed by a colon, and optionally followed by any dependencies. If there are one or more commands needed to build the target, they are listed below, with tabs starting each such line.

Of course, we then need a rule for being sure that brightness.o is up to date, and telling us how to build that:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -c brightness.c

So, what happens if we issue the command "make brightness"? Make starts by building a tree of dependencies. What do we need to build brightness? Answer: an up-to-date brightness.o. What do we need to build that? There's another rule that tells us, and so on. After building the whole tree of dependencies the system will decide that the first check to be made is whether brightness.c been changed since brightness.o was last built. and if so that code will be recompiled. Then, if the brightness exectuable is older than the (possibly recompiled) brightness.o, the executable is relinked. In short, only necessary work is done.

Note that, unlike a script, a makefile is not a list of steps to be performed in order; it's a set of rules, and each rule is considered as needed according to the circumstance. Rules are chosen by pattern matching on filenames and by checking whether any dependencies must be rebuilt. Once a rule is chosen, there may indeed be one or more steps (actually zero or more) specified to build the target.
Pattern rules and automatic variables

Make has many many other sophisticated features, but there's one more you should learn early. Consider this fragment:

# 
#    To get any .o, compile the corresponding .c
#
%.o:%.c 
    gcc $(FLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

Our first approach required a separate rule for each .o, but all of those rules look almost the same. The fragment above uses what make calls pattern rules (e.g. %.c) and automatic variables (e.g. $<). You'll have to read the GNU make documentation for all the details, but what the fragment above says is:

    Every .o file depends on the corresponding .c file
    The name of that .c file is substituted into the gcc command after the -c option

So, a single rule suffices to build a .o file from any corresponding .c file. Also shown in the gcc command line is the substitution of two variables FLAGS and CFLAGS that we can assume have been set with the compiler options that we're using on this project. We can thus ensure that the same compiler options are automatically applied to each compilation. Obviously we can (and should) do something similar on the commands that link the executables.
A realistic example

Appendix II contains a makefile that builds HW assignments 1. With the hints given above you should be able to figure out most of what it's doing.

Right now, the COMP 40 homework submission process expects a compile script not a makefile; you should be sure to provide a working compile script or else your homework may not be graded. Still it's good to know how makefiles work, and we may sometime soon switch to using them for some assignments.
Build scripts as documentation

Like any other code you write, your build scripts and makefiles should be designed as documentation to be read by other programmers. Especially if you use languages like make or mk, your build scripts formally document which pieces of your system depend on which others. Of course, your scripts also document the compiler switches and other settings used.

Make sure your build scripts are cleanly structured and easy to read. When it's not obvious from the code, include comments explaining what various build targets do, and any other information that might be needed by someone maintaining or modifying your code. Be especially careful to document non-obvious dependencies on tools or libraries, e.g.:

# This build runs against the grapics library 
# version 2.8, which is current as of July, 2013.  The 
# program depends on features such as double buffering
# introduced in v2.8.  
# NEEDSWORK We should add an automatic configuration 
# test to ensure double buffering is available.

APPENDIX I: A COMP 40 Compile Script

This is the compile script for a recent version of COMP 40 HW 1. That assignment requires the development of two executables, named brightness and fgroups

APPENDIX II: A COMP 40 Makefile

The following makefile is more or less equivalent to the compile script shown above in Appendex I. Like that script, this makefile defaults to building the brightness and fgroups executables. So, if we assume this file is called Makefile, here are some commands we could issue:

make all          # builds fgroups and brightness and any needed .o files
make              # same as "make all" because all is the default target
make brightness   # builds brightness, and any .o files that needs
make fgroups.o    # recompiles fgroups.o only if fgroups.c is changed
make clean        # remove all .o files and executables fgroups and brightness

Here is the sample makefile:

#            Makefile for COMP 40 Homework 1
#
#     Author: Noah Mendelsohn (adapted from Norman Ramsey's compile script)
#
#  Maintenance targets:
#
#
#    all         - (default target) make sure everything's compiled
#    clean       - clean out all compiled object and executable files
#    brightness  - compile just the brightness program
#    fgroups     - compile just the fingerprint group program.
#
#

# Executables to built using "make all"

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

#
#  The following is a compromise. You MUST list all your .h files here.
#  If any .h file changes, all .c files will be recompiled. To do better,
#  we could make an explicit target for each .o, naming only the .h
#  files it really uses.
#
# Add your own .h files to the right side of the assingment below.

# these flags max out warnings and debug info
FLAGS = -g -O -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -std=c99 -pedantic

# 
#    'make all' will build all executables
#
#    Note that "all" is the default target that make will build
#    if nothing is specifically requested
#
all: $(EXECUTABLES)

# 
#    'make clean' will remove all object and executable files
#
clean:
    rm -f $(EXECUTABLES) *.o


# 
#    To get any .o, compile the corresponding .c
#

What is a script?

In computing, the term script refers to a program that invokes and coordinates the activities of other programs. An application build script is one that invokes compilers, linkers and other tools to compile and link your executable application. As we will see, some build tools are smart enough to understand which pieces of code depend on which others (e.g. which .c files include .h files) and to only recompile what's necessary when small changes are made.
Why use scripts to build your programs?

When you started programming in C++ or in C you probably learned to build your programs this way:

g++ -o myprog myprog.cpp

or

gcc -o myprog myprog.c

These commands use the Gnu compiler to compile a single source file into a runnable Linux executable. Directly calling the compiler this way is perfectly acceptable for simple programs but as you start building more complex programs a number of problems become obvious:

    Most large programs are built from multiple source files. Although it's often possible to name all of these on the command line, doing that is inconvenient.
    You will likely need to set a number of options on the g++ or gcc command line to override compiler defaults, to indicate which directories are to be searched for include files, etc., and you'll have to type those options correctly each time you recompile.
    If your program is big and has lots of source files, recompiling all the pieces each time you make a small change is wasteful.
    You may wish to build several different programs that share some common pieces; in such cases, it's very useful to have a tool that automatically rebuilds everything when shared pieces change.

Application build scripts automate the process of building an application or other program and they can also automate related tasks such as running tests. Build scripts make it much easier to rebuild your program, and that in turn should encourage you to recompile and test frequently as you create your program. Build scripts also help other programmers learn how to recompile and link your code.

In COMP 40, we rely on compile scripts with a known interface to build your homework submissions. That is, when you submit your program you will include a build script, and it must be invokable in just the way we specify. Typically we require a shell script named compile which, when run with no arguments, builds all the code and applications we've asked you to submit. Our test scripts depend on that compile script to build your code for testing. (Some assignments may ask for compile scripts in other forms, such as using a makefile, as described below).
What tools can you use to build your scripts?

In principle, any programming language or tool that can invoke other command line programs can be used to create application build scripts. These include general purpose scripting languages such as Python, PERL and Ruby; shell languages like sh, bash, csh and ksh; and tools like make, mk, ant, raven, maven, etc. that are designed specifically for creating application build scripts. Of these many choices, there are two (or maybe three) that you should know about for COMP 40:

    Shell languages (e.g. sh)

    When you are typing on the console of your Unix login session you are talking to a program known as a shell. This is a program that reads what you type, does some work like expanding filename wildcards, and then invokes the programs you've asked to run. In fact, the shell languages are themselves small prorgramming lanuages; although you usually type one command at a time, you can actually use them to write little loops, if statements, etc. right from the console. The same shell command processors can be used to run shell programs stored in files, but the situation is confused somewhat by the fact that over the years a number of competing shells have been built, each with its own language.

    Regardless of the shell you're running to interpret your console commands, the tradition in COMP 40 is to write compile scripts using the /bin/sh shell language. A section below provides hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh.
    make

    make is the most famous application build language. Although make is somewhat clumsy and ad-hoc in its syntax, it's very powerful and very widely used. If only for that reason, every good programmer should learn to use make.

    The key feature of make and of many other languages designed specifically for building applications is that it allows you to state which pieces of your program depend on which others. When you run make it checks the dates on all your files to determine what's been changed since the last time you built your application, and it rebuilds only files that depend, directly or indirectly, on changed files. You tell make how to do each step in the build process, e.g. how to build multiply.o from multiply.c, and make invokes only the steps that are needed.

    The rules for building each program or application are placed into a file known as a makefile. When you invoke make you can supply the name of the makefile to use:

                 make -f mymakefile myprog
        

    ...will use the makefile named mymakefile to build the program named myprog. If no makefile is named, make will try to find makefile or Makefile (in that order). The following will build myprog using one of those two makefiles.

                 make myprog
        

    When code is distributed for public use it's very common to find a makefile or Makefile along with the code. This is usually a signal that make is the tool to use for building that program.
    mk

    Even Stu Feldman, who many years ago created make, has acknowledged its problems. Among the tools he recommends as an alternative is mk (pronounced "muck"), which was created to support the experimental Plan 9 operating system at Bell Labs.

    The syntax of mk is arguably cleaner and easier to learn than that of make and mk has some powerful features that may be useful when you are building truly complex systems. Norman Ramsey gives a spirited defense of mk in How to Write Compile Scripts.

We may in some cases provide you with tools that are built with make or mk, and you are strongly advised to learn at least the basics of make. It's a skill that will serve you well in your career and one that potential employers may value. Some Hints for writing makefiles are also provided below.

mk is not nearly as widely used as the other tools discussed here but it's got a cleaner design than make and it also is the language we've used behind the scenes to build many of the COMP 40 course materials. You may occasionally see scripts with names like somescript.mk; that .mk suffix likely means that mk is the language being used.
Using build scripts for testing and packaging

Consider using make or other similar tools to integrate testing and packaging with the build process. For example, you might have a make target that does unit testing:

             make test-results

Write your makefile so that the target test-results depends on the executable program(s) being tested. Now if you change some source files and run the above command, make will automatically rebuild your application and immediately run tests on it. That can be a wonderful way to be sure that none of the changes you've made has broken anything that had been working. We strongly encourage you to build your test cases early in the development process and to retest your code after every significant change to the source.

In the same spirit, build targets can be used to invoke tools like valgrind:

             make valgrind-tests

You should have this target depend on an up-to-date build of your system, and then have it run one or more tests of your code using valgrind. Doing this will likely encourage you to run valgrind often, and to be sure that your code is up-to-date when you do.

If you're creating a system that will be distributed to others then a build target to create distribution packages can be very useful:

             make distribution

This would (if necessary) recompile and relink any code that's to be distributed to users in object form and then package the code, perhaps into a tar file, a zip file, or some other form that's convenient for distributing to others.

Of course, all these things can be done equally well with mk or with shell scripts.
Hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh

Here are some hints that may be useful for writing and understanding compile scripts in sh:
Finding documentation on sh

The first place to look for documentation on sh is in the man pages:

man sh

Sometimes doing this gives you the man page for an implementation called bash and indeed on our Tufts CS systems /bin/sh is just a link to /bin/bash; bash has some extensions, but for most of what you'll doing doing sh and bash are compatible. So, either man page is good enough for COMP 40 purposes. In any case, the man pages document the complete syntax of the language and give some instructions for using it. There are also lots of sh and bash tutorials on the Web.
Filename globbing

As we've seen, sh (like bash, csh, tcsh, ksh, etc.) is a language that's designed to interpret commands at an interactive command prompt. One of the services it provides is globbing, in which strings containing characters like * are replaced with a list of filenames matching the expression:

   ls mult*.c    # all files starting with "mult" and ending with .c
   cat [ab]*     # all files starting with "a" or "b"

This is done by replacing the expressions with lists of filenames that become the arguments to commands. So, the second line above might actually turn into the command:

   cat albert anthony.c bertha birtday.html bigdeal.cpp

...if those files happened to be in the current directory. Because sh runs your commands the same way when they come from a script file as from the console, the same globbing is done on every command in your scripts!
Arguments to the script

Your compile script is itself a program that will be invoked (most likely) from the command line. So, your script can be given arguments.

compile -link fgroups

has two arguments: -link and fgroups. You will often see within the compile script code that accesses these parameters. For example:

echo $2

would call the echo command, passing it the second parameter (fgroups for the command above). You can also find out how many parameters there are:

echo $#

echos the number "2", because the script was passed two parameters. You can also work with all the parameters together. If the number of arguments is nargs then:

echo $@    

...is the same as:

echo $1 $2 ... $nargs   

Surprisingly, it's also possible to update the argument list. For example:

shift
echo $@

This would echo only "fgroups", because the shift command shifts all the arguments to the left, and thus "loses" the "-unlink" argument. Such shifting is very commonly done to eliminate arguments such as switches after they have been processed by the script.

set *.c

Somewhat confusingly, the set command completely replaces the command line arguments! After the above command, the original arguments (-link fgroups) are gone, replaced with a list of all .c files. Specifically, globbing is done on *.c, so the set command is given a list of all .c files in the current directory. The set command then sets the argument list to that list of files.

One of the reasons scripts update the argument list is that some important internal script commands default to operating on the argument list:

for cfile 
do
  gcc -c $cfile
done

There are at least two important things to learn from the above example: the for loop iterates over the arguments in $@ (which, after the earlier set command is a list of all the user's .c files). Also, shell scripts have named variables that can be substituted into commands using the $variable_name syntax. So, the above command loops through all the files named in the argument list and calls gcc on each one.

It's also common to set variable names using the = operator. These lines of code are taken from a COMP 40 build script:

CC=gcc

CFLAGS="-I. -I/comp/40/include $CIIFLAGS"
FLAGS="-g -O -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -std=c99 -pedantic"

for cfile 
do
  $CC $FLAGS $CFLAGS -c $cfile
done

You should now be more or less able to understand what commands are executed by that code.
Back quotes

One thing missing from the above is the assignment to $CIIFLAGS. In the actual script, that turns out to use a feature you haven't seen:

CIIFLAGS=`pkg-config --cflags cii40`

Note carefully the backquotes ` surrounding the pkg-config command on the right. Also note that pkg-config has nothing to do with the shell language itself: it's an ordinary command just like gcc, cat or ls.

When a command in a script is in backquotes, the command is run and the output of the command is substituted in place of the quoted command text. So, in this example, the pkg-config command is run with the arguments --cflags cii40; the output of that pkg-config command is assigned to the shell variable CIIFLAGS. (To learn what pkg-config does, try man pkg-config, or else you can just guess that it probably figures out some switches we'll want to pass to the compiler when building something to do with "cii40"...which turns out to be the package name for the Hanson code we use in COMP 40!)
Conditionals

sh has if statements, for loops and many other features of traditional imperative programming languages. You'll need to check the man page for details, but you'll often be able to guess from the syntax what these constructs are doing. One feature for which sh uses a somewhat unusual syntax is conditionals like these::

if [ $linked = no ]; then
  # do something here if variable linked is equal to "no"
fi 

An expression in square brackets is called a conditional, and it evaluates to a boolean true or false. As you can see from the example above, string literals like no need not be quoted unless they contain spaces; variable references must begin with a dollar sign $.

Although the expression in brackets may look like part of the if statement syntax, it's not; the same conditional syntax can be used elsewhere, for example:

[ -n "$2" ] || { echo "You need a second argument to this script" >&2; exit 1; }

Note that the above is of the form: a || b. The expression a, which is the conditional [-n "$2"] is evaluated; if it's false, then expression b on the right is evaluated. That happens to be a compound statement of the form: {stmt1; stmt2;}.

The key to understanding the above example is that [ -n "$2"] is a conditional that tests the length of a string to ensure it's not empty. So, this example writes an error message to standard error only if there is no second argument to the script.

Many conditionals test the existence or nature of named files. for example:


[-e "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists
[-f "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists and is a file (not dir, etc)
[-d "/tmp/somedir"]     # True if /tmp/somedir is a directory

There are many, many other useful conditionals. See the man page for details.
A realistic example

You don't have to understand all of the above in detail on day 1 of COMP 40 but you should rapidly develop an intuition about which parts of each compile script are doing what. That way you will be able to make small modifications to the scripts and to debug them when they break.

Now, take a look at the compile script for a recent version of COMP 40 HW assignments 1; with luck, you'll be able to understand most of what it's doing (several of the fragments above are taken from that script).
The shebang #! convention

This is a good time to learn a Unix scripting techinque that's illustrated on the first line of the sample compile script, which says:

#!/bin/sh

It starts with a #, so the script processor considers it a comment, but it serves a very specific purpose. There are actually two ways you could run this script:

    sh compile -link fgroups: when you do it this way, that first line doesn't matter. You're telling the system to invoke the sh shell and your giving it the name of the script to execute. Whoever does this needs to know that it's an sh script.
    ./compile -link fgroups: done this way, we're treating the script itself as an executable command, but how does Unix know whether to run this using sh (or maybe Python or csh?). That's what that first "shebang" line is for: when you invoke a command that appears to be a text file, Unix (or Linux) looks at the first line. If it starts with:

    #!...some executable name here

    Then the named executable (in our case sh) is run and passed the file as a first argument!

So, we've been able to use our script as if it was a new command named compile (assuming that's the filename of the script). There is one more detail: for this to work you'll need to give your file execute permissions. A likely way to do that is:

chmod u+x compile

which uses the chmod Unix command to indicate that the user (that's the u) who owns the file is to have execute (x) permissions. Of course, you should see man chmod for more information on setting the permission mode.

Oh, and why is it called the "shebang" convention? The "#" character is the "sharp sign" or "hash" (or "number sign"), and the "!" character programmers call "bang". So, shebang. You'll often hear a programmer who's reading a string to another programmer pronounce it in this style: "hash bang slash bin slash usr", etc.

(By the way, if you're not bored yet, you'll surely want to know that the etyomology of the word shebang is surprisingly varied and ambiguous...and if that's not sufficiently obscure detail, the # sign is also known as the octothorpe!)
Hints for writing makefiles

There are many make tutorials and sample makefiles available on the Web. Of course, you should also do man make, and also consult the extensive reference manual for GNU Make (do try to avoid using GNU extensions unless needed). Here we give a short introduction to what make can do.
Tabs and spaces

One important warning about make: tabs and spaces aren't interchangeable!. When you see a rule like this in a makefile:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -o brightness brightness.c

there is a tab character (not spaces!) ahead of the command "gcc" on the second line. If your editor has a feature that replaces tabs with spaces, you'll have to turn that off when editing makefiles! (This is just an example of why people complain about make. Still, it's a very powerful tool that can do very useful things for you.)
Variables

Like shell scripts, makefiles allow you to set and substitute named variables:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: $(EXECUTABLES)

is more or less equivalent to:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: brightness fgroups

Targets and Dependencies

Consider again that same fragment:

all: brightness fgroups

This tells make that if the user says:

make all

...then it's necessary to ensure that fgroups and brightness are up to date. We say that the target all depends on fgroups and brightness. But how can the make system know whether those program(s) actually need to be rebuilt? Somewhere in the makefile should be another rule telling what those two programs depend on, and how to build them. A very simple rule might be:

brightness: brightness.o
    gcc -o brightness brightness.o 

which says to build brightness by linking brightness.o. Note that each rule starts with a target name in the left margin, followed by a colon, and optionally followed by any dependencies. If there are one or more commands needed to build the target, they are listed below, with tabs starting each such line.

Of course, we then need a rule for being sure that brightness.o is up to date, and telling us how to build that:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -c brightness.c

So, what happens if we issue the command "make brightness"? Make starts by building a tree of dependencies. What do we need to build brightness? Answer: an up-to-date brightness.o. What do we need to build that? There's another rule that tells us, and so on. After building the whole tree of dependencies the system will decide that the first check to be made is whether brightness.c been changed since brightness.o was last built. and if so that code will be recompiled. Then, if the brightness exectuable is older than the (possibly recompiled) brightness.o, the executable is relinked. In short, only necessary work is done.

Note that, unlike a script, a makefile is not a list of steps to be performed in order; it's a set of rules, and each rule is considered as needed according to the circumstance. Rules are chosen by pattern matching on filenames and by checking whether any dependencies must be rebuilt. Once a rule is chosen, there may indeed be one or more steps (actually zero or more) specified to build the target.
Pattern rules and automatic variables

Make has many many other sophisticated features, but there's one more you should learn early. Consider this fragment:

# 
#    To get any .o, compile the corresponding .c
#
%.o:%.c 
    gcc $(FLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

Our first approach required a separate rule for each .o, but all of those rules look almost the same. The fragment above uses what make calls pattern rules (e.g. %.c) and automatic variables (e.g. $<). You'll have to read the GNU make documentation for all the details, but what the fragment above says is:

    Every .o file depends on the corresponding .c file
    The name of that .c file is substituted into the gcc command after the -c option

So, a single rule suffices to build a .o file from any corresponding .c file. Also shown in the gcc command line is the substitution of two variables FLAGS and CFLAGS that we can assume have been set with the compiler options that we're using on this project. We can thus ensure that the same compiler options are automatically applied to each compilation. Obviously we can (and should) do something similar on the commands that link the executables.
A realistic example

Appendix II contains a makefile that builds HW assignments 1. With the hints given above you should be able to figure out most of what it's doing.

Right now, the COMP 40 homework submission process expects a compile script not a makefile; you should be sure to provide a working compile script or else your homework may not be graded. Still it's good to know how makefiles work, and we may sometime soon switch to using them for some assignments.
Build scripts as documentation

Like any other code you write, your build scripts and makefiles should be designed as documentation to be read by other programmers. Especially if you use languages like make or mk, your build scripts formally document which pieces of your system depend on which others. Of course, your scripts also document the compiler switches and other settings used.

Make sure your build scripts are cleanly structured and easy to read. When it's not obvious from the code, include comments explaining what various build targets do, and any other information that might be needed by someone maintaining or modifying your code. Be especially careful to document non-obvious dependencies on tools or libraries, e.g.:

# This build runs against the grapics library 
# version 2.8, which is current as of July, 2013.  The 
# program depends on features such as double buffering
# introduced in v2.8.  
# NEEDSWORK We should add an automatic configuration 
# test to ensure double buffering is available.

APPENDIX I: A COMP 40 Compile Script

APPENDIX II: A COMP 40 Makefile

The following makefile is more or less equivalent to the compile script shown above in Appendex I. Like that script, this makefile defaults to building the brightness and fgroups executables. So, if we assume this file is called Makefile, here are some commands we could issue:

make all          # builds fgroups and brightness and any needed .o files
make              # same as "make all" because all is the default target
make brightness   # builds brightness, and any .o files that needs
make fgroups.o    # recompiles fgroups.o only if fgroups.c is changed
make clean        # remove all .o files and executables fgroups and brightness

Here is the sample makefile:

#            Makefile for COMP 40 Homework 1
#
#     Author: Noah Mendelsohn (adapted from Norman Ramsey's compile script)
#
#  Maintenance targets:
#
#
#    all         - (default target) make sure everything's compiled
#    clean       - clean out all compiled object and executable files
#    brightness  - compile just the brightness program
#    fgroups     - compile just the fingerprint group program.
#
#

# Executables to built using "make all"

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

#
#  The following is a compromise. You MUST list all your .h files here.
#  If any .h file changes, all .c files will be recompiled. To do better,
#  we could make an explicit target for each .o, naming only the .h
#  files it really uses.
#

What is a script?

In computing, the term script refers to a program that invokes and coordinates the activities of other programs. An application build script is one that invokes compilers, linkers and other tools to compile and link your executable application. As we will see, some build tools are smart enough to understand which pieces of code depend on which others (e.g. which .c files include .h files) and to only recompile what's necessary when small changes are made.
Why use scripts to build your programs?

When you started programming in C++ or in C you probably learned to build your programs this way:

g++ -o myprog myprog.cpp

or

gcc -o myprog myprog.c

These commands use the Gnu compiler to compile a single source file into a runnable Linux executable. Directly calling the compiler this way is perfectly acceptable for simple programs but as you start building more complex programs a number of problems become obvious:

    Most large programs are built from multiple source files. Although it's often possible to name all of these on the command line, doing that is inconvenient.
    You will likely need to set a number of options on the g++ or gcc command line to override compiler defaults, to indicate which directories are to be searched for include files, etc., and you'll have to type those options correctly each time you recompile.
    If your program is big and has lots of source files, recompiling all the pieces each time you make a small change is wasteful.
    You may wish to build several different programs that share some common pieces; in such cases, it's very useful to have a tool that automatically rebuilds everything when shared pieces change.

Application build scripts automate the process of building an application or other program and they can also automate related tasks such as running tests. Build scripts make it much easier to rebuild your program, and that in turn should encourage you to recompile and test frequently as you create your program. Build scripts also help other programmers learn how to recompile and link your code.

In COMP 40, we rely on compile scripts with a known interface to build your homework submissions. That is, when you submit your program you will include a build script, and it must be invokable in just the way we specify. Typically we require a shell script named compile which, when run with no arguments, builds all the code and applications we've asked you to submit. Our test scripts depend on that compile script to build your code for testing. (Some assignments may ask for compile scripts in other forms, such as using a makefile, as described below).
What tools can you use to build your scripts?

In principle, any programming language or tool that can invoke other command line programs can be used to create application build scripts. These include general purpose scripting languages such as Python, PERL and Ruby; shell languages like sh, bash, csh and ksh; and tools like make, mk, ant, raven, maven, etc. that are designed specifically for creating application build scripts. Of these many choices, there are two (or maybe three) that you should know about for COMP 40:

    Shell languages (e.g. sh)

    When you are typing on the console of your Unix login session you are talking to a program known as a shell. This is a program that reads what you type, does some work like expanding filename wildcards, and then invokes the programs you've asked to run. In fact, the shell languages are themselves small prorgramming lanuages; although you usually type one command at a time, you can actually use them to write little loops, if statements, etc. right from the console. The same shell command processors can be used to run shell programs stored in files, but the situation is confused somewhat by the fact that over the years a number of competing shells have been built, each with its own language.

    Regardless of the shell you're running to interpret your console commands, the tradition in COMP 40 is to write compile scripts using the /bin/sh shell language. A section below provides hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh.
    make

    make is the most famous application build language. Although make is somewhat clumsy and ad-hoc in its syntax, it's very powerful and very widely used. If only for that reason, every good programmer should learn to use make.

    The key feature of make and of many other languages designed specifically for building applications is that it allows you to state which pieces of your program depend on which others. When you run make it checks the dates on all your files to determine what's been changed since the last time you built your application, and it rebuilds only files that depend, directly or indirectly, on changed files. You tell make how to do each step in the build process, e.g. how to build multiply.o from multiply.c, and make invokes only the steps that are needed.

    The rules for building each program or application are placed into a file known as a makefile. When you invoke make you can supply the name of the makefile to use:

                 make -f mymakefile myprog
        

    ...will use the makefile named mymakefile to build the program named myprog. If no makefile is named, make will try to find makefile or Makefile (in that order). The following will build myprog using one of those two makefiles.

                 make myprog
        

    When code is distributed for public use it's very common to find a makefile or Makefile along with the code. This is usually a signal that make is the tool to use for building that program.
    mk

    Even Stu Feldman, who many years ago created make, has acknowledged its problems. Among the tools he recommends as an alternative is mk (pronounced "muck"), which was created to support the experimental Plan 9 operating system at Bell Labs.

    The syntax of mk is arguably cleaner and easier to learn than that of make and mk has some powerful features that may be useful when you are building truly complex systems. Norman Ramsey gives a spirited defense of mk in How to Write Compile Scripts.

We may in some cases provide you with tools that are built with make or mk, and you are strongly advised to learn at least the basics of make. It's a skill that will serve you well in your career and one that potential employers may value. Some Hints for writing makefiles are also provided below.

mk is not nearly as widely used as the other tools discussed here but it's got a cleaner design than make and it also is the language we've used behind the scenes to build many of the COMP 40 course materials. You may occasionally see scripts with names like somescript.mk; that .mk suffix likely means that mk is the language being used.
Using build scripts for testing and packaging

Consider using make or other similar tools to integrate testing and packaging with the build process. For example, you might have a make target that does unit testing:

             make test-results

Write your makefile so that the target test-results depends on the executable program(s) being tested. Now if you change some source files and run the above command, make will automatically rebuild your application and immediately run tests on it. That can be a wonderful way to be sure that none of the changes you've made has broken anything that had been working. We strongly encourage you to build your test cases early in the development process and to retest your code after every significant change to the source.

In the same spirit, build targets can be used to invoke tools like valgrind:

             make valgrind-tests

You should have this target depend on an up-to-date build of your system, and then have it run one or more tests of your code using valgrind. Doing this will likely encourage you to run valgrind often, and to be sure that your code is up-to-date when you do.

If you're creating a system that will be distributed to others then a build target to create distribution packages can be very useful:

             make distribution

This would (if necessary) recompile and relink any code that's to be distributed to users in object form and then package the code, perhaps into a tar file, a zip file, or some other form that's convenient for distributing to others.

Of course, all these things can be done equally well with mk or with shell scripts.
Hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh

Here are some hints that may be useful for writing and understanding compile scripts in sh:
Finding documentation on sh

The first place to look for documentation on sh is in the man pages:

man sh

Sometimes doing this gives you the man page for an implementation called bash and indeed on our Tufts CS systems /bin/sh is just a link to /bin/bash; bash has some extensions, but for most of what you'll doing doing sh and bash are compatible. So, either man page is good enough for COMP 40 purposes. In any case, the man pages document the complete syntax of the language and give some instructions for using it. There are also lots of sh and bash tutorials on the Web.
Filename globbing

As we've seen, sh (like bash, csh, tcsh, ksh, etc.) is a language that's designed to interpret commands at an interactive command prompt. One of the services it provides is globbing, in which strings containing characters like * are replaced with a list of filenames matching the expression:

   ls mult*.c    # all files starting with "mult" and ending with .c
   cat [ab]*     # all files starting with "a" or "b"

This is done by replacing the expressions with lists of filenames that become the arguments to commands. So, the second line above might actually turn into the command:

   cat albert anthony.c bertha birtday.html bigdeal.cpp

...if those files happened to be in the current directory. Because sh runs your commands the same way when they come from a script file as from the console, the same globbing is done on every command in your scripts!
Arguments to the script

Your compile script is itself a program that will be invoked (most likely) from the command line. So, your script can be given arguments.

compile -link fgroups

has two arguments: -link and fgroups. You will often see within the compile script code that accesses these parameters. For example:

echo $2

would call the echo command, passing it the second parameter (fgroups for the command above). You can also find out how many parameters there are:

echo $#

echos the number "2", because the script was passed two parameters. You can also work with all the parameters together. If the number of arguments is nargs then:

echo $@    

...is the same as:

echo $1 $2 ... $nargs   

Surprisingly, it's also possible to update the argument list. For example:

shift
echo $@

This would echo only "fgroups", because the shift command shifts all the arguments to the left, and thus "loses" the "-unlink" argument. Such shifting is very commonly done to eliminate arguments such as switches after they have been processed by the script.

set *.c

Somewhat confusingly, the set command completely replaces the command line arguments! After the above command, the original arguments (-link fgroups) are gone, replaced with a list of all .c files. Specifically, globbing is done on *.c, so the set command is given a list of all .c files in the current directory. The set command then sets the argument list to that list of files.

One of the reasons scripts update the argument list is that some important internal script commands default to operating on the argument list:

for cfile 
do
  gcc -c $cfile
done

There are at least two important things to learn from the above example: the for loop iterates over the arguments in $@ (which, after the earlier set command is a list of all the user's .c files). Also, shell scripts have named variables that can be substituted into commands using the $variable_name syntax. So, the above command loops through all the files named in the argument list and calls gcc on each one.

It's also common to set variable names using the = operator. These lines of code are taken from a COMP 40 build script:

CC=gcc

CFLAGS="-I. -I/comp/40/include $CIIFLAGS"
FLAGS="-g -O -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -std=c99 -pedantic"

for cfile 
do
  $CC $FLAGS $CFLAGS -c $cfile
done

You should now be more or less able to understand what commands are executed by that code.
Back quotes

One thing missing from the above is the assignment to $CIIFLAGS. In the actual script, that turns out to use a feature you haven't seen:

CIIFLAGS=`pkg-config --cflags cii40`

Note carefully the backquotes ` surrounding the pkg-config command on the right. Also note that pkg-config has nothing to do with the shell language itself: it's an ordinary command just like gcc, cat or ls.

When a command in a script is in backquotes, the command is run and the output of the command is substituted in place of the quoted command text. So, in this example, the pkg-config command is run with the arguments --cflags cii40; the output of that pkg-config command is assigned to the shell variable CIIFLAGS. (To learn what pkg-config does, try man pkg-config, or else you can just guess that it probably figures out some switches we'll want to pass to the compiler when building something to do with "cii40"...which turns out to be the package name for the Hanson code we use in COMP 40!)
Conditionals

sh has if statements, for loops and many other features of traditional imperative programming languages. You'll need to check the man page for details, but you'll often be able to guess from the syntax what these constructs are doing. One feature for which sh uses a somewhat unusual syntax is conditionals like these::

if [ $linked = no ]; then
  # do something here if variable linked is equal to "no"
fi 

An expression in square brackets is called a conditional, and it evaluates to a boolean true or false. As you can see from the example above, string literals like no need not be quoted unless they contain spaces; variable references must begin with a dollar sign $.

Although the expression in brackets may look like part of the if statement syntax, it's not; the same conditional syntax can be used elsewhere, for example:

[ -n "$2" ] || { echo "You need a second argument to this script" >&2; exit 1; }

Note that the above is of the form: a || b. The expression a, which is the conditional [-n "$2"] is evaluated; if it's false, then expression b on the right is evaluated. That happens to be a compound statement of the form: {stmt1; stmt2;}.

The key to understanding the above example is that [ -n "$2"] is a conditional that tests the length of a string to ensure it's not empty. So, this example writes an error message to standard error only if there is no second argument to the script.

Many conditionals test the existence or nature of named files. for example:


[-e "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists
[-f "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists and is a file (not dir, etc)
[-d "/tmp/somedir"]     # True if /tmp/somedir is a directory

There are many, many other useful conditionals. See the man page for details.
A realistic example

You don't have to understand all of the above in detail on day 1 of COMP 40 but you should rapidly develop an intuition about which parts of each compile script are doing what. That way you will be able to make small modifications to the scripts and to debug them when they break.

Now, take a look at the compile script for a recent version of COMP 40 HW assignments 1; with luck, you'll be able to understand most of what it's doing (several of the fragments above are taken from that script).
The shebang #! convention

This is a good time to learn a Unix scripting techinque that's illustrated on the first line of the sample compile script, which says:

#!/bin/sh

It starts with a #, so the script processor considers it a comment, but it serves a very specific purpose. There are actually two ways you could run this script:

    sh compile -link fgroups: when you do it this way, that first line doesn't matter. You're telling the system to invoke the sh shell and your giving it the name of the script to execute. Whoever does this needs to know that it's an sh script.
    ./compile -link fgroups: done this way, we're treating the script itself as an executable command, but how does Unix know whether to run this using sh (or maybe Python or csh?). That's what that first "shebang" line is for: when you invoke a command that appears to be a text file, Unix (or Linux) looks at the first line. If it starts with:

    #!...some executable name here

    Then the named executable (in our case sh) is run and passed the file as a first argument!

So, we've been able to use our script as if it was a new command named compile (assuming that's the filename of the script). There is one more detail: for this to work you'll need to give your file execute permissions. A likely way to do that is:

chmod u+x compile

which uses the chmod Unix command to indicate that the user (that's the u) who owns the file is to have execute (x) permissions. Of course, you should see man chmod for more information on setting the permission mode.

Oh, and why is it called the "shebang" convention? The "#" character is the "sharp sign" or "hash" (or "number sign"), and the "!" character programmers call "bang". So, shebang. You'll often hear a programmer who's reading a string to another programmer pronounce it in this style: "hash bang slash bin slash usr", etc.

(By the way, if you're not bored yet, you'll surely want to know that the etyomology of the word shebang is surprisingly varied and ambiguous...and if that's not sufficiently obscure detail, the # sign is also known as the octothorpe!)
Hints for writing makefiles

There are many make tutorials and sample makefiles available on the Web. Of course, you should also do man make, and also consult the extensive reference manual for GNU Make (do try to avoid using GNU extensions unless needed). Here we give a short introduction to what make can do.
Tabs and spaces

One important warning about make: tabs and spaces aren't interchangeable!. When you see a rule like this in a makefile:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -o brightness brightness.c

there is a tab character (not spaces!) ahead of the command "gcc" on the second line. If your editor has a feature that replaces tabs with spaces, you'll have to turn that off when editing makefiles! (This is just an example of why people complain about make. Still, it's a very powerful tool that can do very useful things for you.)
Variables

Like shell scripts, makefiles allow you to set and substitute named variables:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: $(EXECUTABLES)

is more or less equivalent to:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: brightness fgroups

Targets and Dependencies

Consider again that same fragment:

all: brightness fgroups

This tells make that if the user says:

make all

...then it's necessary to ensure that fgroups and brightness are up to date. We say that the target all depends on fgroups and brightness. But how can the make system know whether those program(s) actually need to be rebuilt? Somewhere in the makefile should be another rule telling what those two programs depend on, and how to build them. A very simple rule might be:

brightness: brightness.o
    gcc -o brightness brightness.o 

which says to build brightness by linking brightness.o. Note that each rule starts with a target name in the left margin, followed by a colon, and optionally followed by any dependencies. If there are one or more commands needed to build the target, they are listed below, with tabs starting each such line.

Of course, we then need a rule for being sure that brightness.o is up to date, and telling us how to build that:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -c brightness.c

So, what happens if we issue the command "make brightness"? Make starts by building a tree of dependencies. What do we need to build brightness? Answer: an up-to-date brightness.o. What do we need to build that? There's another rule that tells us, and so on. After building the whole tree of dependencies the system will decide that the first check to be made is whether brightness.c been changed since brightness.o was last built. and if so that code will be recompiled. Then, if the brightness exectuable is older than the (possibly recompiled) brightness.o, the executable is relinked. In short, only necessary work is done.

Note that, unlike a script, a makefile is not a list of steps to be performed in order; it's a set of rules, and each rule is considered as needed according to the circumstance. Rules are chosen by pattern matching on filenames and by checking whether any dependencies must be rebuilt. Once a rule is chosen, there may indeed be one or more steps (actually zero or more) specified to build the target.
Pattern rules and automatic variables

Make has many many other sophisticated features, but there's one more you should learn early. Consider this fragment:

# 
#    To get any .o, compile the corresponding .c
#
%.o:%.c 
    gcc $(FLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

Our first approach required a separate rule for each .o, but all of those rules look almost the same. The fragment above uses what make calls pattern rules (e.g. %.c) and automatic variables (e.g. $<). You'll have to read the GNU make documentation for all the details, but what the fragment above says is:

    Every .o file depends on the corresponding .c file
    The name of that .c file is substituted into the gcc command after the -c option

So, a single rule suffices to build a .o file from any corresponding .c file. Also shown in the gcc command line is the substitution of two variables FLAGS and CFLAGS that we can assume have been set with the compiler options that we're using on this project. We can thus ensure that the same compiler options are automatically applied to each compilation. Obviously we can (and should) do something similar on the commands that link the executables.
A realistic example

Appendix II contains a makefile that builds HW assignments 1. With the hints given above you should be able to figure out most of what it's doing.

Right now, the COMP 40 homework submission process expects a compile script not a makefile; you should be sure to provide a working compile script or else your homework may not be graded. Still it's good to know how makefiles work, and we may sometime soon switch to using them for some assignments.
Build scripts as documentation

Like any other code you write, your build scripts and makefiles should be designed as documentation to be read by other programmers. Especially if you use languages like make or mk, your build scripts formally document which pieces of your system depend on which others. Of course, your scripts also document the compiler switches and other settings used.

Make sure your build scripts are cleanly structured and easy to read. When it's not obvious from the code, include comments explaining what various build targets do, and any other information that might be needed by someone maintaining or modifying your code. Be especially careful to document non-obvious dependencies on tools or libraries, e.g.:

# This build runs against the grapics library 
# version 2.8, which is current as of July, 2013.  The 
# program depends on features such as double buffering
# introduced in v2.8.  
# NEEDSWORK We should add an automatic configuration 
# test to ensure double buffering is available.

APPENDIX I: A COMP 40 Compile Script

APPENDIX II: A COMP 40 Makefile

The following makefile is more or less equivalent to the compile script shown above in Appendex I. Like that script, this makefile defaults to building the brightness and fgroups executables. So, if we assume this file is called Makefile, here are some commands we could issue:

make all          # builds fgroups and brightness and any needed .o files
make              # same as "make all" because all is the default target
make brightness   # builds brightness, and any .o files that needs
make fgroups.o    # recompiles fgroups.o only if fgroups.c is changed
make clean        # remove all .o files and executables fgroups and brightness

Here is the sample makefile:

#            Makefile for COMP 40 Homework 1
#
#     Author: Noah Mendelsohn (adapted from Norman Ramsey's compile script)
#
#  Maintenance targets:
#
#
#    all         - (default target) make sure everything's compiled
#    clean       - clean out all compiled object and executable files
#    brightness  - compile just the brightness program
#    fgroups     - compile just the fingerprint group program.
#
#

# Executables to built using "make all"

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

#
#  The following is a compromise. You MUST list all your .h files here.
#  If any .h file changes, all .c files will be recompiled. To do better,
#  we could make an explicit target for each .o, naming only the .h
#  files it really uses.
#
# Add your own .h files to the right side of the assingment below.

#

#
#    Note that "all" is the default target that make will build
#    if nothing is specifically requested
#

# 
#    'make clean' will remove all object and executable files

What is a script?

In computing, the term script refers to a program that invokes and coordinates the activities of other programs. An application build script is one that invokes compilers, linkers and other tools to compile and link your executable application. As we will see, some build tools are smart enough to understand which pieces of code depend on which others (e.g. which .c files include .h files) and to only recompile what's necessary when small changes are made.
Why use scripts to build your programs?

When you started programming in C++ or in C you probably learned to build your programs this way:

g++ -o myprog myprog.cpp

or

gcc -o myprog myprog.c

These commands use the Gnu compiler to compile a single source file into a runnable Linux executable. Directly calling the compiler this way is perfectly acceptable for simple programs but as you start building more complex programs a number of problems become obvious:

    Most large programs are built from multiple source files. Although it's often possible to name all of these on the command line, doing that is inconvenient.
    You will likely need to set a number of options on the g++ or gcc command line to override compiler defaults, to indicate which directories are to be searched for include files, etc., and you'll have to type those options correctly each time you recompile.
    If your program is big and has lots of source files, recompiling all the pieces each time you make a small change is wasteful.
    You may wish to build several different programs that share some common pieces; in such cases, it's very useful to have a tool that automatically rebuilds everything when shared pieces change.

Application build scripts automate the process of building an application or other program and they can also automate related tasks such as running tests. Build scripts make it much easier to rebuild your program, and that in turn should encourage you to recompile and test frequently as you create your program. Build scripts also help other programmers learn how to recompile and link your code.

In COMP 40, we rely on compile scripts with a known interface to build your homework submissions. That is, when you submit your program you will include a build script, and it must be invokable in just the way we specify. Typically we require a shell script named compile which, when run with no arguments, builds all the code and applications we've asked you to submit. Our test scripts depend on that compile script to build your code for testing. (Some assignments may ask for compile scripts in other forms, such as using a makefile, as described below).
What tools can you use to build your scripts?

In principle, any programming language or tool that can invoke other command line programs can be used to create application build scripts. These include general purpose scripting languages such as Python, PERL and Ruby; shell languages like sh, bash, csh and ksh; and tools like make, mk, ant, raven, maven, etc. that are designed specifically for creating application build scripts. Of these many choices, there are two (or maybe three) that you should know about for COMP 40:

    Shell languages (e.g. sh)

    When you are typing on the console of your Unix login session you are talking to a program known as a shell. This is a program that reads what you type, does some work like expanding filename wildcards, and then invokes the programs you've asked to run. In fact, the shell languages are themselves small prorgramming lanuages; although you usually type one command at a time, you can actually use them to write little loops, if statements, etc. right from the console. The same shell command processors can be used to run shell programs stored in files, but the situation is confused somewhat by the fact that over the years a number of competing shells have been built, each with its own language.

    Regardless of the shell you're running to interpret your console commands, the tradition in COMP 40 is to write compile scripts using the /bin/sh shell language. A section below provides hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh.
    make

    make is the most famous application build language. Although make is somewhat clumsy and ad-hoc in its syntax, it's very powerful and very widely used. If only for that reason, every good programmer should learn to use make.

    The key feature of make and of many other languages designed specifically for building applications is that it allows you to state which pieces of your program depend on which others. When you run make it checks the dates on all your files to determine what's been changed since the last time you built your application, and it rebuilds only files that depend, directly or indirectly, on changed files. You tell make how to do each step in the build process, e.g. how to build multiply.o from multiply.c, and make invokes only the steps that are needed.

    The rules for building each program or application are placed into a file known as a makefile. When you invoke make you can supply the name of the makefile to use:

                 make -f mymakefile myprog
        

    ...will use the makefile named mymakefile to build the program named myprog. If no makefile is named, make will try to find makefile or Makefile (in that order). The following will build myprog using one of those two makefiles.

                 make myprog
        

    When code is distributed for public use it's very common to find a makefile or Makefile along with the code. This is usually a signal that make is the tool to use for building that program.
    mk

    Even Stu Feldman, who many years ago created make, has acknowledged its problems. Among the tools he recommends as an alternative is mk (pronounced "muck"), which was created to support the experimental Plan 9 operating system at Bell Labs.

    The syntax of mk is arguably cleaner and easier to learn than that of make and mk has some powerful features that may be useful when you are building truly complex systems. Norman Ramsey gives a spirited defense of mk in How to Write Compile Scripts.

We may in some cases provide you with tools that are built with make or mk, and you are strongly advised to learn at least the basics of make. It's a skill that will serve you well in your career and one that potential employers may value. Some Hints for writing makefiles are also provided below.

mk is not nearly as widely used as the other tools discussed here but it's got a cleaner design than make and it also is the language we've used behind the scenes to build many of the COMP 40 course materials. You may occasionally see scripts with names like somescript.mk; that .mk suffix likely means that mk is the language being used.
Using build scripts for testing and packaging

Consider using make or other similar tools to integrate testing and packaging with the build process. For example, you might have a make target that does unit testing:

             make test-results

Write your makefile so that the target test-results depends on the executable program(s) being tested. Now if you change some source files and run the above command, make will automatically rebuild your application and immediately run tests on it. That can be a wonderful way to be sure that none of the changes you've made has broken anything that had been working. We strongly encourage you to build your test cases early in the development process and to retest your code after every significant change to the source.

In the same spirit, build targets can be used to invoke tools like valgrind:

             make valgrind-tests

You should have this target depend on an up-to-date build of your system, and then have it run one or more tests of your code using valgrind. Doing this will likely encourage you to run valgrind often, and to be sure that your code is up-to-date when you do.

If you're creating a system that will be distributed to others then a build target to create distribution packages can be very useful:

             make distribution

This would (if necessary) recompile and relink any code that's to be distributed to users in object form and then package the code, perhaps into a tar file, a zip file, or some other form that's convenient for distributing to others.

Of course, all these things can be done equally well with mk or with shell scripts.
Hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh

Here are some hints that may be useful for writing and understanding compile scripts in sh:
Finding documentation on sh

The first place to look for documentation on sh is in the man pages:

man sh

Sometimes doing this gives you the man page for an implementation called bash and indeed on our Tufts CS systems /bin/sh is just a link to /bin/bash; bash has some extensions, but for most of what you'll doing doing sh and bash are compatible. So, either man page is good enough for COMP 40 purposes. In any case, the man pages document the complete syntax of the language and give some instructions for using it. There are also lots of sh and bash tutorials on the Web.
Filename globbing

As we've seen, sh (like bash, csh, tcsh, ksh, etc.) is a language that's designed to interpret commands at an interactive command prompt. One of the services it provides is globbing, in which strings containing characters like * are replaced with a list of filenames matching the expression:

   ls mult*.c    # all files starting with "mult" and ending with .c
   cat [ab]*     # all files starting with "a" or "b"

This is done by replacing the expressions with lists of filenames that become the arguments to commands. So, the second line above might actually turn into the command:

   cat albert anthony.c bertha birtday.html bigdeal.cpp

...if those files happened to be in the current directory. Because sh runs your commands the same way when they come from a script file as from the console, the same globbing is done on every command in your scripts!
Arguments to the script

Your compile script is itself a program that will be invoked (most likely) from the command line. So, your script can be given arguments.

compile -link fgroups

has two arguments: -link and fgroups. You will often see within the compile script code that accesses these parameters. For example:

echo $2

would call the echo command, passing it the second parameter (fgroups for the command above). You can also find out how many parameters there are:

echo $#

echos the number "2", because the script was passed two parameters. You can also work with all the parameters together. If the number of arguments is nargs then:

echo $@    

...is the same as:

echo $1 $2 ... $nargs   

Surprisingly, it's also possible to update the argument list. For example:

shift
echo $@

This would echo only "fgroups", because the shift command shifts all the arguments to the left, and thus "loses" the "-unlink" argument. Such shifting is very commonly done to eliminate arguments such as switches after they have been processed by the script.

set *.c

Somewhat confusingly, the set command completely replaces the command line arguments! After the above command, the original arguments (-link fgroups) are gone, replaced with a list of all .c files. Specifically, globbing is done on *.c, so the set command is given a list of all .c files in the current directory. The set command then sets the argument list to that list of files.

One of the reasons scripts update the argument list is that some important internal script commands default to operating on the argument list:

for cfile 
do
  gcc -c $cfile
done

There are at least two important things to learn from the above example: the for loop iterates over the arguments in $@ (which, after the earlier set command is a list of all the user's .c files). Also, shell scripts have named variables that can be substituted into commands using the $variable_name syntax. So, the above command loops through all the files named in the argument list and calls gcc on each one.

It's also common to set variable names using the = operator. These lines of code are taken from a COMP 40 build script:

CC=gcc

CFLAGS="-I. -I/comp/40/include $CIIFLAGS"
FLAGS="-g -O -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -std=c99 -pedantic"

for cfile 
do
  $CC $FLAGS $CFLAGS -c $cfile
done

You should now be more or less able to understand what commands are executed by that code.
Back quotes

One thing missing from the above is the assignment to $CIIFLAGS. In the actual script, that turns out to use a feature you haven't seen:

CIIFLAGS=`pkg-config --cflags cii40`

Note carefully the backquotes ` surrounding the pkg-config command on the right. Also note that pkg-config has nothing to do with the shell language itself: it's an ordinary command just like gcc, cat or ls.

When a command in a script is in backquotes, the command is run and the output of the command is substituted in place of the quoted command text. So, in this example, the pkg-config command is run with the arguments --cflags cii40; the output of that pkg-config command is assigned to the shell variable CIIFLAGS. (To learn what pkg-config does, try man pkg-config, or else you can just guess that it probably figures out some switches we'll want to pass to the compiler when building something to do with "cii40"...which turns out to be the package name for the Hanson code we use in COMP 40!)
Conditionals

sh has if statements, for loops and many other features of traditional imperative programming languages. You'll need to check the man page for details, but you'll often be able to guess from the syntax what these constructs are doing. One feature for which sh uses a somewhat unusual syntax is conditionals like these::

if [ $linked = no ]; then
  # do something here if variable linked is equal to "no"
fi 

An expression in square brackets is called a conditional, and it evaluates to a boolean true or false. As you can see from the example above, string literals like no need not be quoted unless they contain spaces; variable references must begin with a dollar sign $.

Although the expression in brackets may look like part of the if statement syntax, it's not; the same conditional syntax can be used elsewhere, for example:

[ -n "$2" ] || { echo "You need a second argument to this script" >&2; exit 1; }

Note that the above is of the form: a || b. The expression a, which is the conditional [-n "$2"] is evaluated; if it's false, then expression b on the right is evaluated. That happens to be a compound statement of the form: {stmt1; stmt2;}.

The key to understanding the above example is that [ -n "$2"] is a conditional that tests the length of a string to ensure it's not empty. So, this example writes an error message to standard error only if there is no second argument to the script.

Many conditionals test the existence or nature of named files. for example:


[-e "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists
[-f "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists and is a file (not dir, etc)
[-d "/tmp/somedir"]     # True if /tmp/somedir is a directory

There are many, many other useful conditionals. See the man page for details.
A realistic example

You don't have to understand all of the above in detail on day 1 of COMP 40 but you should rapidly develop an intuition about which parts of each compile script are doing what. That way you will be able to make small modifications to the scripts and to debug them when they break.

Now, take a look at the compile script for a recent version of COMP 40 HW assignments 1; with luck, you'll be able to understand most of what it's doing (several of the fragments above are taken from that script).
The shebang #! convention

This is a good time to learn a Unix scripting techinque that's illustrated on the first line of the sample compile script, which says:

#!/bin/sh

It starts with a #, so the script processor considers it a comment, but it serves a very specific purpose. There are actually two ways you could run this script:

    sh compile -link fgroups: when you do it this way, that first line doesn't matter. You're telling the system to invoke the sh shell and your giving it the name of the script to execute. Whoever does this needs to know that it's an sh script.
    ./compile -link fgroups: done this way, we're treating the script itself as an executable command, but how does Unix know whether to run this using sh (or maybe Python or csh?). That's what that first "shebang" line is for: when you invoke a command that appears to be a text file, Unix (or Linux) looks at the first line. If it starts with:

    #!...some executable name here

    Then the named executable (in our case sh) is run and passed the file as a first argument!

So, we've been able to use our script as if it was a new command named compile (assuming that's the filename of the script). There is one more detail: for this to work you'll need to give your file execute permissions. A likely way to do that is:

chmod u+x compile

which uses the chmod Unix command to indicate that the user (that's the u) who owns the file is to have execute (x) permissions. Of course, you should see man chmod for more information on setting the permission mode.

Oh, and why is it called the "shebang" convention? The "#" character is the "sharp sign" or "hash" (or "number sign"), and the "!" character programmers call "bang". So, shebang. You'll often hear a programmer who's reading a string to another programmer pronounce it in this style: "hash bang slash bin slash usr", etc.

(By the way, if you're not bored yet, you'll surely want to know that the etyomology of the word shebang is surprisingly varied and ambiguous...and if that's not sufficiently obscure detail, the # sign is also known as the octothorpe!)
Hints for writing makefiles

There are many make tutorials and sample makefiles available on the Web. Of course, you should also do man make, and also consult the extensive reference manual for GNU Make (do try to avoid using GNU extensions unless needed). Here we give a short introduction to what make can do.
Tabs and spaces

One important warning about make: tabs and spaces aren't interchangeable!. When you see a rule like this in a makefile:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -o brightness brightness.c

there is a tab character (not spaces!) ahead of the command "gcc" on the second line. If your editor has a feature that replaces tabs with spaces, you'll have to turn that off when editing makefiles! (This is just an example of why people complain about make. Still, it's a very powerful tool that can do very useful things for you.)
Variables

Like shell scripts, makefiles allow you to set and substitute named variables:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: $(EXECUTABLES)

is more or less equivalent to:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: brightness fgroups

Targets and Dependencies

Consider again that same fragment:

all: brightness fgroups

This tells make that if the user says:

make all

...then it's necessary to ensure that fgroups and brightness are up to date. We say that the target all depends on fgroups and brightness. But how can the make system know whether those program(s) actually need to be rebuilt? Somewhere in the makefile should be another rule telling what those two programs depend on, and how to build them. A very simple rule might be:

brightness: brightness.o
    gcc -o brightness brightness.o 

which says to build brightness by linking brightness.o. Note that each rule starts with a target name in the left margin, followed by a colon, and optionally followed by any dependencies. If there are one or more commands needed to build the target, they are listed below, with tabs starting each such line.

Of course, we then need a rule for being sure that brightness.o is up to date, and telling us how to build that:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -c brightness.c

So, what happens if we issue the command "make brightness"? Make starts by building a tree of dependencies. What do we need to build brightness? Answer: an up-to-date brightness.o. What do we need to build that? There's another rule that tells us, and so on. After building the whole tree of dependencies the system will decide that the first check to be made is whether brightness.c been changed since brightness.o was last built. and if so that code will be recompiled. Then, if the brightness exectuable is older than the (possibly recompiled) brightness.o, the executable is relinked. In short, only necessary work is done.

Note that, unlike a script, a makefile is not a list of steps to be performed in order; it's a set of rules, and each rule is considered as needed according to the circumstance. Rules are chosen by pattern matching on filenames and by checking whether any dependencies must be rebuilt. Once a rule is chosen, there may indeed be one or more steps (actually zero or more) specified to build the target.
Pattern rules and automatic variables

Make has many many other sophisticated features, but there's one more you should learn early. Consider this fragment:

# 
#    To get any .o, compile the corresponding .c
#
%.o:%.c 
    gcc $(FLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

Our first approach required a separate rule for each .o, but all of those rules look almost the same. The fragment above uses what make calls pattern rules (e.g. %.c) and automatic variables (e.g. $<). You'll have to read the GNU make documentation for all the details, but what the fragment above says is:

    Every .o file depends on the corresponding .c file
    The name of that .c file is substituted into the gcc command after the -c option

So, a single rule suffices to build a .o file from any corresponding .c file. Also shown in the gcc command line is the substitution of two variables FLAGS and CFLAGS that we can assume have been set with the compiler options that we're using on this project. We can thus ensure that the same compiler options are automatically applied to each compilation. Obviously we can (and should) do something similar on the commands that link the executables.
A realistic example

Appendix II contains a makefile that builds HW assignments 1. With the hints given above you should be able to figure out most of what it's doing.

Right now, the COMP 40 homework submission process expects a compile script not a makefile; you should be sure to provide a working compile script or else your homework may not be graded. Still it's good to know how makefiles work, and we may sometime soon switch to using them for some assignments.
Build scripts as documentation

Like any other code you write, your build scripts and makefiles should be designed as documentation to be read by other programmers. Especially if you use languages like make or mk, your build scripts formally document which pieces of your system depend on which others. Of course, your scripts also document the compiler switches and other settings used.

Make sure your build scripts are cleanly structured and easy to read. When it's not obvious from the code, include comments explaining what various build targets do, and any other information that might be needed by someone maintaining or modifying your code. Be especially careful to document non-obvious dependencies on tools or libraries, e.g.:

# This build runs against the grapics library 
# version 2.8, which is current as of July, 2013.  The 
# program depends on features such as double buffering
# introduced in v2.8.  
# NEEDSWORK We should add an automatic configuration 
# test to ensure double buffering is available.

APPENDIX I: A COMP 40 Compile Script

APPENDIX II: A COMP 40 Makefile

The following makefile is more or less equivalent to the compile script shown above in Appendex I. Like that script, this makefile defaults to building the brightness and fgroups executables. So, if we assume this file is called Makefile, here are some commands we could issue:

make all          # builds fgroups and brightness and any needed .o files
make              # same as "make all" because all is the default target
make brightness   # builds brightness, and any .o files that needs
make fgroups.o    # recompiles fgroups.o only if fgroups.c is changed
make clean        # remove all .o files and executables fgroups and brightness

Here is the sample makefile:

#            Makefile for COMP 40 Homework 1
#
#     Author: Noah Mendelsohn (adapted from Norman Ramsey's compile script)
#
#  Maintenance targets:
#
#
#    all         - (default target) make sure everything's compiled
#    clean       - clean out all compiled object and executable files
#    brightness  - compile just the brightness program
#    fgroups     - compile just the fingerprint group program.
#
#

# Executables to built using "make all"

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

#
#  The following is a compromise. You MUST list all your .h files here.
#  If any .h file changes, all .c files will be recompiled. To do better,
#  we could make an explicit target for each .o, naming only the .h
#  files it really uses.

What is a script?

In computing, the term script refers to a program that invokes and coordinates the activities of other programs. An application build script is one that invokes compilers, linkers and other tools to compile and link your executable application. As we will see, some build tools are smart enough to understand which pieces of code depend on which others (e.g. which .c files include .h files) and to only recompile what's necessary when small changes are made.
Why use scripts to build your programs?

When you started programming in C++ or in C you probably learned to build your programs this way:

g++ -o myprog myprog.cpp

or

gcc -o myprog myprog.c

These commands use the Gnu compiler to compile a single source file into a runnable Linux executable. Directly calling the compiler this way is perfectly acceptable for simple programs but as you start building more complex programs a number of problems become obvious:

    Most large programs are built from multiple source files. Although it's often possible to name all of these on the command line, doing that is inconvenient.
    You will likely need to set a number of options on the g++ or gcc command line to override compiler defaults, to indicate which directories are to be searched for include files, etc., and you'll have to type those options correctly each time you recompile.
    If your program is big and has lots of source files, recompiling all the pieces each time you make a small change is wasteful.
    You may wish to build several different programs that share some common pieces; in such cases, it's very useful to have a tool that automatically rebuilds everything when shared pieces change.

Application build scripts automate the process of building an application or other program and they can also automate related tasks such as running tests. Build scripts make it much easier to rebuild your program, and that in turn should encourage you to recompile and test frequently as you create your program. Build scripts also help other programmers learn how to recompile and link your code.

In COMP 40, we rely on compile scripts with a known interface to build your homework submissions. That is, when you submit your program you will include a build script, and it must be invokable in just the way we specify. Typically we require a shell script named compile which, when run with no arguments, builds all the code and applications we've asked you to submit. Our test scripts depend on that compile script to build your code for testing. (Some assignments may ask for compile scripts in other forms, such as using a makefile, as described below).
What tools can you use to build your scripts?

In principle, any programming language or tool that can invoke other command line programs can be used to create application build scripts. These include general purpose scripting languages such as Python, PERL and Ruby; shell languages like sh, bash, csh and ksh; and tools like make, mk, ant, raven, maven, etc. that are designed specifically for creating application build scripts. Of these many choices, there are two (or maybe three) that you should know about for COMP 40:

    Shell languages (e.g. sh)

    When you are typing on the console of your Unix login session you are talking to a program known as a shell. This is a program that reads what you type, does some work like expanding filename wildcards, and then invokes the programs you've asked to run. In fact, the shell languages are themselves small prorgramming lanuages; although you usually type one command at a time, you can actually use them to write little loops, if statements, etc. right from the console. The same shell command processors can be used to run shell programs stored in files, but the situation is confused somewhat by the fact that over the years a number of competing shells have been built, each with its own language.

    Regardless of the shell you're running to interpret your console commands, the tradition in COMP 40 is to write compile scripts using the /bin/sh shell language. A section below provides hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh.
    make

    make is the most famous application build language. Although make is somewhat clumsy and ad-hoc in its syntax, it's very powerful and very widely used. If only for that reason, every good programmer should learn to use make.

    The key feature of make and of many other languages designed specifically for building applications is that it allows you to state which pieces of your program depend on which others. When you run make it checks the dates on all your files to determine what's been changed since the last time you built your application, and it rebuilds only files that depend, directly or indirectly, on changed files. You tell make how to do each step in the build process, e.g. how to build multiply.o from multiply.c, and make invokes only the steps that are needed.

    The rules for building each program or application are placed into a file known as a makefile. When you invoke make you can supply the name of the makefile to use:

                 make -f mymakefile myprog
        

    ...will use the makefile named mymakefile to build the program named myprog. If no makefile is named, make will try to find makefile or Makefile (in that order). The following will build myprog using one of those two makefiles.

                 make myprog
        

    When code is distributed for public use it's very common to find a makefile or Makefile along with the code. This is usually a signal that make is the tool to use for building that program.
    mk

    Even Stu Feldman, who many years ago created make, has acknowledged its problems. Among the tools he recommends as an alternative is mk (pronounced "muck"), which was created to support the experimental Plan 9 operating system at Bell Labs.

    The syntax of mk is arguably cleaner and easier to learn than that of make and mk has some powerful features that may be useful when you are building truly complex systems. Norman Ramsey gives a spirited defense of mk in How to Write Compile Scripts.

We may in some cases provide you with tools that are built with make or mk, and you are strongly advised to learn at least the basics of make. It's a skill that will serve you well in your career and one that potential employers may value. Some Hints for writing makefiles are also provided below.

mk is not nearly as widely used as the other tools discussed here but it's got a cleaner design than make and it also is the language we've used behind the scenes to build many of the COMP 40 course materials. You may occasionally see scripts with names like somescript.mk; that .mk suffix likely means that mk is the language being used.
Using build scripts for testing and packaging

Consider using make or other similar tools to integrate testing and packaging with the build process. For example, you might have a make target that does unit testing:

             make test-results

Write your makefile so that the target test-results depends on the executable program(s) being tested. Now if you change some source files and run the above command, make will automatically rebuild your application and immediately run tests on it. That can be a wonderful way to be sure that none of the changes you've made has broken anything that had been working. We strongly encourage you to build your test cases early in the development process and to retest your code after every significant change to the source.

In the same spirit, build targets can be used to invoke tools like valgrind:

             make valgrind-tests

You should have this target depend on an up-to-date build of your system, and then have it run one or more tests of your code using valgrind. Doing this will likely encourage you to run valgrind often, and to be sure that your code is up-to-date when you do.

If you're creating a system that will be distributed to others then a build target to create distribution packages can be very useful:

             make distribution

This would (if necessary) recompile and relink any code that's to be distributed to users in object form and then package the code, perhaps into a tar file, a zip file, or some other form that's convenient for distributing to others.

Of course, all these things can be done equally well with mk or with shell scripts.
Hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh

Here are some hints that may be useful for writing and understanding compile scripts in sh:
Finding documentation on sh

The first place to look for documentation on sh is in the man pages:

man sh

Sometimes doing this gives you the man page for an implementation called bash and indeed on our Tufts CS systems /bin/sh is just a link to /bin/bash; bash has some extensions, but for most of what you'll doing doing sh and bash are compatible. So, either man page is good enough for COMP 40 purposes. In any case, the man pages document the complete syntax of the language and give some instructions for using it. There are also lots of sh and bash tutorials on the Web.
Filename globbing

As we've seen, sh (like bash, csh, tcsh, ksh, etc.) is a language that's designed to interpret commands at an interactive command prompt. One of the services it provides is globbing, in which strings containing characters like * are replaced with a list of filenames matching the expression:

   ls mult*.c    # all files starting with "mult" and ending with .c
   cat [ab]*     # all files starting with "a" or "b"

This is done by replacing the expressions with lists of filenames that become the arguments to commands. So, the second line above might actually turn into the command:

   cat albert anthony.c bertha birtday.html bigdeal.cpp

...if those files happened to be in the current directory. Because sh runs your commands the same way when they come from a script file as from the console, the same globbing is done on every command in your scripts!
Arguments to the script

Your compile script is itself a program that will be invoked (most likely) from the command line. So, your script can be given arguments.

compile -link fgroups

has two arguments: -link and fgroups. You will often see within the compile script code that accesses these parameters. For example:

echo $2

would call the echo command, passing it the second parameter (fgroups for the command above). You can also find out how many parameters there are:

echo $#

echos the number "2", because the script was passed two parameters. You can also work with all the parameters together. If the number of arguments is nargs then:

echo $@    

...is the same as:

echo $1 $2 ... $nargs   

Surprisingly, it's also possible to update the argument list. For example:

shift
echo $@

This would echo only "fgroups", because the shift command shifts all the arguments to the left, and thus "loses" the "-unlink" argument. Such shifting is very commonly done to eliminate arguments such as switches after they have been processed by the script.

set *.c

Somewhat confusingly, the set command completely replaces the command line arguments! After the above command, the original arguments (-link fgroups) are gone, replaced with a list of all .c files. Specifically, globbing is done on *.c, so the set command is given a list of all .c files in the current directory. The set command then sets the argument list to that list of files.

One of the reasons scripts update the argument list is that some important internal script commands default to operating on the argument list:

for cfile 
do
  gcc -c $cfile
done

There are at least two important things to learn from the above example: the for loop iterates over the arguments in $@ (which, after the earlier set command is a list of all the user's .c files). Also, shell scripts have named variables that can be substituted into commands using the $variable_name syntax. So, the above command loops through all the files named in the argument list and calls gcc on each one.

It's also common to set variable names using the = operator. These lines of code are taken from a COMP 40 build script:

CC=gcc

CFLAGS="-I. -I/comp/40/include $CIIFLAGS"
FLAGS="-g -O -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -std=c99 -pedantic"

for cfile 
do
  $CC $FLAGS $CFLAGS -c $cfile
done

You should now be more or less able to understand what commands are executed by that code.
Back quotes

One thing missing from the above is the assignment to $CIIFLAGS. In the actual script, that turns out to use a feature you haven't seen:

CIIFLAGS=`pkg-config --cflags cii40`

Note carefully the backquotes ` surrounding the pkg-config command on the right. Also note that pkg-config has nothing to do with the shell language itself: it's an ordinary command just like gcc, cat or ls.

When a command in a script is in backquotes, the command is run and the output of the command is substituted in place of the quoted command text. So, in this example, the pkg-config command is run with the arguments --cflags cii40; the output of that pkg-config command is assigned to the shell variable CIIFLAGS. (To learn what pkg-config does, try man pkg-config, or else you can just guess that it probably figures out some switches we'll want to pass to the compiler when building something to do with "cii40"...which turns out to be the package name for the Hanson code we use in COMP 40!)
Conditionals

sh has if statements, for loops and many other features of traditional imperative programming languages. You'll need to check the man page for details, but you'll often be able to guess from the syntax what these constructs are doing. One feature for which sh uses a somewhat unusual syntax is conditionals like these::

if [ $linked = no ]; then
  # do something here if variable linked is equal to "no"
fi 

An expression in square brackets is called a conditional, and it evaluates to a boolean true or false. As you can see from the example above, string literals like no need not be quoted unless they contain spaces; variable references must begin with a dollar sign $.

Although the expression in brackets may look like part of the if statement syntax, it's not; the same conditional syntax can be used elsewhere, for example:

[ -n "$2" ] || { echo "You need a second argument to this script" >&2; exit 1; }

Note that the above is of the form: a || b. The expression a, which is the conditional [-n "$2"] is evaluated; if it's false, then expression b on the right is evaluated. That happens to be a compound statement of the form: {stmt1; stmt2;}.

The key to understanding the above example is that [ -n "$2"] is a conditional that tests the length of a string to ensure it's not empty. So, this example writes an error message to standard error only if there is no second argument to the script.

Many conditionals test the existence or nature of named files. for example:


[-e "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists
[-f "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists and is a file (not dir, etc)
[-d "/tmp/somedir"]     # True if /tmp/somedir is a directory

There are many, many other useful conditionals. See the man page for details.
A realistic example

You don't have to understand all of the above in detail on day 1 of COMP 40 but you should rapidly develop an intuition about which parts of each compile script are doing what. That way you will be able to make small modifications to the scripts and to debug them when they break.

Now, take a look at the compile script for a recent version of COMP 40 HW assignments 1; with luck, you'll be able to understand most of what it's doing (several of the fragments above are taken from that script).
The shebang #! convention

This is a good time to learn a Unix scripting techinque that's illustrated on the first line of the sample compile script, which says:

#!/bin/sh

It starts with a #, so the script processor considers it a comment, but it serves a very specific purpose. There are actually two ways you could run this script:

    sh compile -link fgroups: when you do it this way, that first line doesn't matter. You're telling the system to invoke the sh shell and your giving it the name of the script to execute. Whoever does this needs to know that it's an sh script.
    ./compile -link fgroups: done this way, we're treating the script itself as an executable command, but how does Unix know whether to run this using sh (or maybe Python or csh?). That's what that first "shebang" line is for: when you invoke a command that appears to be a text file, Unix (or Linux) looks at the first line. If it starts with:

    #!...some executable name here

    Then the named executable (in our case sh) is run and passed the file as a first argument!

So, we've been able to use our script as if it was a new command named compile (assuming that's the filename of the script). There is one more detail: for this to work you'll need to give your file execute permissions. A likely way to do that is:

chmod u+x compile

which uses the chmod Unix command to indicate that the user (that's the u) who owns the file is to have execute (x) permissions. Of course, you should see man chmod for more information on setting the permission mode.

Oh, and why is it called the "shebang" convention? The "#" character is the "sharp sign" or "hash" (or "number sign"), and the "!" character programmers call "bang". So, shebang. You'll often hear a programmer who's reading a string to another programmer pronounce it in this style: "hash bang slash bin slash usr", etc.

(By the way, if you're not bored yet, you'll surely want to know that the etyomology of the word shebang is surprisingly varied and ambiguous...and if that's not sufficiently obscure detail, the # sign is also known as the octothorpe!)
Hints for writing makefiles

There are many make tutorials and sample makefiles available on the Web. Of course, you should also do man make, and also consult the extensive reference manual for GNU Make (do try to avoid using GNU extensions unless needed). Here we give a short introduction to what make can do.
Tabs and spaces

One important warning about make: tabs and spaces aren't interchangeable!. When you see a rule like this in a makefile:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -o brightness brightness.c

there is a tab character (not spaces!) ahead of the command "gcc" on the second line. If your editor has a feature that replaces tabs with spaces, you'll have to turn that off when editing makefiles! (This is just an example of why people complain about make. Still, it's a very powerful tool that can do very useful things for you.)
Variables

Like shell scripts, makefiles allow you to set and substitute named variables:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: $(EXECUTABLES)

is more or less equivalent to:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: brightness fgroups

Targets and Dependencies

Consider again that same fragment:

all: brightness fgroups

This tells make that if the user says:

make all

...then it's necessary to ensure that fgroups and brightness are up to date. We say that the target all depends on fgroups and brightness. But how can the make system know whether those program(s) actually need to be rebuilt? Somewhere in the makefile should be another rule telling what those two programs depend on, and how to build them. A very simple rule might be:

brightness: brightness.o
    gcc -o brightness brightness.o 

which says to build brightness by linking brightness.o. Note that each rule starts with a target name in the left margin, followed by a colon, and optionally followed by any dependencies. If there are one or more commands needed to build the target, they are listed below, with tabs starting each such line.

Of course, we then need a rule for being sure that brightness.o is up to date, and telling us how to build that:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -c brightness.c

So, what happens if we issue the command "make brightness"? Make starts by building a tree of dependencies. What do we need to build brightness? Answer: an up-to-date brightness.o. What do we need to build that? There's another rule that tells us, and so on. After building the whole tree of dependencies the system will decide that the first check to be made is whether brightness.c been changed since brightness.o was last built. and if so that code will be recompiled. Then, if the brightness exectuable is older than the (possibly recompiled) brightness.o, the executable is relinked. In short, only necessary work is done.

Note that, unlike a script, a makefile is not a list of steps to be performed in order; it's a set of rules, and each rule is considered as needed according to the circumstance. Rules are chosen by pattern matching on filenames and by checking whether any dependencies must be rebuilt. Once a rule is chosen, there may indeed be one or more steps (actually zero or more) specified to build the target.
Pattern rules and automatic variables

Make has many many other sophisticated features, but there's one more you should learn early. Consider this fragment:

# 
#    To get any .o, compile the corresponding .c
#
%.o:%.c 
    gcc $(FLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

Our first approach required a separate rule for each .o, but all of those rules look almost the same. The fragment above uses what make calls pattern rules (e.g. %.c) and automatic variables (e.g. $<). You'll have to read the GNU make documentation for all the details, but what the fragment above says is:

    Every .o file depends on the corresponding .c file
    The name of that .c file is substituted into the gcc command after the -c option

So, a single rule suffices to build a .o file from any corresponding .c file. Also shown in the gcc command line is the substitution of two variables FLAGS and CFLAGS that we can assume have been set with the compiler options that we're using on this project. We can thus ensure that the same compiler options are automatically applied to each compilation. Obviously we can (and should) do something similar on the commands that link the executables.
A realistic example

Appendix II contains a makefile that builds HW assignments 1. With the hints given above you should be able to figure out most of what it's doing.

Right now, the COMP 40 homework submission process expects a compile script not a makefile; you should be sure to provide a working compile script or else your homework may not be graded. Still it's good to know how makefiles work, and we may sometime soon switch to using them for some assignments.
Build scripts as documentation

Like any other code you write, your build scripts and makefiles should be designed as documentation to be read by other programmers. Especially if you use languages like make or mk, your build scripts formally document which pieces of your system depend on which others. Of course, your scripts also document the compiler switches and other settings used.

Make sure your build scripts are cleanly structured and easy to read. When it's not obvious from the code, include comments explaining what various build targets do, and any other information that might be needed by someone maintaining or modifying your code. Be especially careful to document non-obvious dependencies on tools or libraries, e.g.:

# This build runs against the grapics library 
# version 2.8, which is current as of July, 2013.  The 
# program depends on features such as double buffering
# introduced in v2.8.  
# NEEDSWORK We should add an automatic configuration 
# test to ensure double buffering is available.

APPENDIX I: A COMP 40 Compile Script

This is the compile script for a recent version of COMP 40 HW 1. That assignment requires the development of two executables, named brightness and fgroups

APPENDIX II: A COMP 40 Makefile

The following makefile is more or less equivalent to the compile script shown above in Appendex I. Like that script, this makefile defaults to building the brightness and fgroups executables. So, if we assume this file is called Makefile, here are some commands we could issue:

make all          # builds fgroups and brightness and any needed .o files
make              # same as "make all" because all is the default target
make brightness   # builds brightness, and any .o files that needs
make fgroups.o    # recompiles fgroups.o only if fgroups.c is changed
make clean        # remove all .o files and executables fgroups and brightness

Here is the sample makefile:

#            Makefile for COMP 40 Homework 1
#
#     Author: Noah Mendelsohn (adapted from Norman Ramsey's compile script)
#
#  Maintenance targets:
#
#
#    all         - (default target) make sure everything's compiled
#    clean       - clean out all compiled object and executable files
#    brightness  - compile just the brightness program
#    fgroups     - compile just the fingerprint group program.
#
#

# Executables to built using "make all"

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

#
#  The following is a compromise. You MUST list all your .h files here.
#  If any .h file changes, all .c files will be recompiled. To do better,
#  we could make an explicit target for each .o, naming only the .h
#  files it really uses.
#
# Add your own .h files to the right side of the assingment below.

INCLUDES = 

# Do all C compies with gcc (at home you could try clang)
GCC = gcc

# Comp 40 directory

COMP40 = /comp/40

# the next two lines enable you to compile and link against CII40
CIIFLAGS = `pkg-config --cflags cii40`
CIILIBS = `pkg-config --libs cii40`

# the next three lines enable you to compile and link against course software
CFLAGS = -I. -I$(COMP40)/include $(CIIFLAGS)
LIBS = $(CIILIBS) -lm    
LFLAGS = -L$(COMP40)/lib64

# these flags max out warnings and debug info
FLAGS = -g -O -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -std=c99 -pedantic

# 
#    'make all' will build all executables
#
#    Note that "all" is the default target that make will build
#    if nothing is specifically requested
#
all: $(EXECUTABLES)

# 
#    'make clean' will remove all object and executable files
#
clean:
    rm -f $(EXECUTABLES) *.o


# 
#    To get any .o, compile the corresponding .c
#
%.o:%.c $(INCLUDES)
    $(GCC) $(FLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

#
# Individual executables
#
#    Each executable depends on one or more .o files.
#    Those .o files are linked together to build the corresponding
#    executable.
#
brightness: brightness.o
    $(GCC) $(FLAGS) $(LFLAGS) -o brightness brightness.o -lpnmrdr $(LIBS)

fgroups: fgroups.o
    $(GCC) $(FLAGS) $(LFLAGS) -o fgroups  fgroups.o $(LIBS)

echo:
    echo "$(CIIFLAGS)"

Everyone Loses if Britain Exits the E.U.

The prospect of a British exit from the European Union has been around for a long time. Britain never fully warmed to the idea of the European Union, and the “euroskeptics” clamoring to get out give the impression that nothing the union could offer would sway them.

A referendum on British membership has been promised by Prime Minister David Cameron and will go before British voters as early as June. A vote to withdraw, or a “Brexit,” would deal a serious blow to a European Union already battered by an economic crisis and an immigration crisis. With all that in mind, the European Council president, Donald Tusk, released a proposal on Tuesday to modify Britain’s obligations to the bloc that he says goes “really far in addressing all the concerns raised by Prime Minister Cameron.”

Mr. Tusk’s plan would create a special mechanism to protect non-euro members — Britain never adopted the euro and proudly uses its own currency — from any unfair advantage eurozone countries may have. It would allow Britain to reduce welfare payments to non-British European citizens living in Britain. It would formally recognize the “opt-out” clause that allows Britain to reject some European Union measures, such as taking in a set quota of refugees. And it would acknowledge Britain’s right to sovereignty.

Britain benefits enormously from membership in the union’s common market and, as a member, it is also able to influence European policies. It would lose on both counts if it were to withdraw, and that would affect Britain’s ties to NATO and to the United States. The Tusk proposal gives Britain leeway to distance itself from policies it finds onerous. As Mr. Cameron accurately argues, Britain would then have the “best of both worlds.”

Now he must make that case to Britain’s skeptics, which will not be easy in a nation worried about the sanctity and safety of its borders. The tide of refugees from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa willing to brave the weather, stormy seas and closed borders grows larger by the day. More than 67,000 refugees have arrived in Europe by sea since the start of this year. The newcomers join more than one million people who sought refuge in Europe last year, adding new strains to already depressed economies. This has been of serious concern in Britain. But if it pulls out of the union, it will have no more say on European migration policies and no right to help in policing the tunnel entrance in Calais, France, where thousands of migrants trying to reach its shores have massed.

Mr. Tusk’s job now is to persuade the other 27 members of the union to accept the concessions to Britain; his proposal is being debated in the European Parliament ahead of the European Summit meeting in Brussels on Feb. 18 and 19. One controversial point is the provision allowing Britain to curb social benefits for European workers in Britain. But not to compromise, Mr. Tusk warns, “would be compromising our common future.” And that would be a tragedy for Britain, other European nations, and for a world that needs a united and prosperous Europe.

Beneath the surface of the global financial system lurks a multitrillion-dollar problem that could sap the strength of large economies for years to come.

The problem is the giant, stagnant pool of loans that companies and people around the world are struggling to pay back. Bad debts have been a drag on economic activity ever since the financial crisis of 2008, but in recent months, the threat posed by an overhang of bad loans appears to be rising. China is the biggest source of worry. Some analysts estimate that China’s troubled credit could exceed $5 trillion, a staggering number that is equivalent to half the size of the country’s annual economic output.

Official figures show that Chinese banks pulled back on their lending in December. If such trends persist, China’s economy, the second-largest in the world behind the United States’, may then slow even more than it has, further harming the many countries that have for years relied on China for their growth.

But it’s not just China. Wherever governments and central banks unleashed aggressive stimulus policies in recent years, a toxic debt hangover has followed. In the United States, it took many months for mortgage defaults to fall after the most recent housing bust — and energy companies are struggling to pay off the cheap money that they borrowed to pile into the shale boom.

Why China Is Rattling the World

China’s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.

In Europe, analysts say bad loans total more than $1 trillion. Many large European banks are still burdened with defaulted loans, complicating policy makers’ efforts to revive the Continent’s economy. Italy, for instance, announced a plan last week to clean out bad loans from its plodding banking industry.

Elsewhere, bad loans are on the rise at Brazil’s biggest banks, as the country grapples with the effects of an enormous credit binge.

“If you have a boom and then a bust, you create economic losses,” said Alberto Gallo, head of global macro credit research at the Royal Bank of Scotland in London. “You can hope the losses one day turn into profits, but if they don’t, they are a drag on the economy.”

In good times, companies and people take on new loans, often at low interest rates, to buy goods and services. When economies slow, these debts become difficult to pay for many borrowers. And the bigger the boom, the more soured debt that is left behind for bankers and policy makers to deal with.

    Op-Ed Columnist: When China StumblesJAN. 8, 2016

In theory, it makes sense for banks to swiftly recognize the losses embedded in bad loans — and then make up for those losses by raising fresh capital. The cleaned-up banks are more likely to start lending again — and thus play their part in fueling the recovery.

But in reality, this approach can be difficult to carry out. Recognizing losses on bad loans can mean pushing corporate borrowers into bankruptcy and households into foreclosure. Such disruption can send a chill through the economy, require unpopular taxpayer bailouts and have painful social consequences. And in some cases, the banks might find it extremely difficult to raise fresh capital in the markets.

Continue reading the main story

Even so, the drawback of delaying the cleanup is that the banks remain wounded and reluctant to lend, damping any recovery that takes place. Japan, economists say, waited far too long after its credit boom of the 1980s to force its banks to recognize huge losses — and the economy suffered for years after as a result.

Now many banking experts are beginning to worry about China’s bad loans.

Fears that the country’s economy is slowing have weighed heavily on global markets in recent months because a weak China can drag down growth globally.

Many of these concerns focus on China’s banking industry. In recent years, banks and other financial companies in China issued a tidal wave of new loans and other credit products, many of which will not be paid back in full.

China’s financial sector will have loans and other financial assets of $30 trillion at the end of this year, up from $9 trillion seven years ago, said Charlene Chu, an analyst in Hong Kong for Autonomous Research.

“The world has never seen credit growth of this magnitude over a such short time,” she said in an email. “We believe it has directly or indirectly impacted nearly every asset price in the world, which is why the market is so jittery about the idea that credit problems in China could unravel.”

Headline figures for bad loans in China most likely do not capture the size of the problem, analysts say. In her analysis, Ms. Chu estimates that at the end of 2016, as much as 22 percent of the Chinese financial system’s loans and assets will be “nonperforming,” a banking industry term used to describe when a borrower has fallen behind on payments or is stressed in ways that make full repayment unlikely. In dollar terms, that works out to $6.6 trillion of troubled loans and assets.

“This estimate really isn’t that unreasonable,” Ms. Chu said in the email. “We’ve seen similar ratios in other countries. What’s different is the scale, which reflects the massive size of China’s credit boom.” She estimates that the bad loans could lead to $4.4 trillion of actual losses.

Although there is not enough official data to come up with a precise figure for bad loans, other analysts have come up with estimates of around $5 trillion.

Given the murkiness of the Chinese financial industry, other analysts arrive at estimates for a “baseline” figure for bad loans. Christopher Balding, an associate professor at the HSBC School of Business at Peking University, said that an analysis of corporations’ interest payments to Chinese banks suggested that 8 percent of loans to companies might be troubled. But Mr. Balding said it was possible that the bad loan number for China’s overall financial system could be higher.

The looming question for the global economy, however, is how China might deal with a vast pool of bad debts.

After a previous credit boom in the 1990s, the Chinese government provided financial support to help clean up the country’s banks. But the cost of similar interventions today could be dauntingly high given the size of the latest credit boom. And more immediately, rising bad debts could crimp lending to strong companies, undermining economic growth in the process.

“My sense is that the Chinese policy makers seem like a deer in the headlights,” Mr. Balding said. “They really don’t know what to do.”

In Europe, for instance, some countries have taken years to come to grips with their banks’ bad loans.

In some cases, the delay arose from a reluctance, at least in part, to force people out of their homes. Even though Ireland’s biggest banks suffered huge losses after the financial crisis, they held back from forcing many borrowers who had defaulted out of their homes. In recent years, the Irish government has pursued a widespread plan that aims to reduce the debt load of financially stressed homeowners. Such forbearance appears not to have weakened the Irish economy, which has recovered at a faster rate than those of other European countries.

Still, the perils of waiting too long are evident in Italy, which in January announced a proposal to help banks sell their bad loans. Some critics of the plan say it resembles a government bailout of the banks, while other skeptics say the banks might not use it because it appears to be too expensive.

“The big problem in the Italian system is that they acted very late,” said Silvia Merler, an affiliate fellow at Bruegel, a European research firm that focuses on economic issues. “They could have done something smarter — and they could have done it earlier.”

MANCHESTER, N.H. — In the crowded New Hampshire primary, no candidate may shape the direction of the Republican presidential campaign more than the man who finished sixth in Iowa: Jeb Bush.

With Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Donald J. Trump and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida each finishing more than 20 percentage points higher than Mr. Bush in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, the former Florida governor is facing growing pressure to either demonstrate his appeal to voters or leave the race.

Specifically, many Republicans — including some of his supporters and donors — said that Mr. Bush must finish ahead of Mr. Rubio in the primary here next Tuesday to justify continuing his campaign into South Carolina.

“If Rubio beats him badly in New Hampshire, Jeb is toast,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, a Bush backer who spent most of Tuesday traveling the state with him. Mr. Graham added that Mr. Bush must either “tie Rubio or beat him” in this state.

The burden falls so heavily on Mr. Bush, who won just 2.8 percent of the vote in Iowa, because of Republican anxieties about the top two finishers there, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump: Many party leaders fear that the nomination of Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz would lead to an electoral rout this fall.

Snapshots From New Hampshire

The days between the nation’s first and second presidential nominating contest are intense – and often emotional, for voters and candidates alike.

Were Mr. Bush to keep campaigning into South Carolina, he could create a split among pragmatic-minded voters, denying Mr. Rubio the chance to consolidate this bloc of Republicans — and strengthening the hands of Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump. Many Republicans believe that if Mr. Rubio, who won an unexpected 23 percent in Iowa, right behind Mr. Trump’s 24 percent, again delivers a strong performance in New Hampshire, he will have earned the right to carry the banner for the party establishment.

Asked Tuesday evening by reporters how well he felt he needed to do in New Hampshire to justify staying in the race, Mr. Bush struck a defiant note.

“Oh, I’m continuing on,” he said. “I’m continuing on, yeah.”

Two rivals, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, are appealing to the same voters and also need a strong showing in New Hampshire. But Mr. Bush is far better financed and organized and can most likely stay in the race longer than they can otherwise.

While Mr. Bush had $7.6 million in the bank and the “super PAC” supporting him had an additional $58.6 million as of Jan. 1, Mr. Kasich had just $2.5 million and Mr. Christie a paltry $1.1 million. And neither Mr. Christie nor Mr. Kasich, both of whom have spent the vast majority of their time in New Hampshire, has much in the way of organization in South Carolina.

Mr. Bush, by contrast, has an active network of supporters there and has tapped into Mr. Graham’s organization. And perhaps most important, the super PAC supporting Mr. Bush has shown a willingness, to put it mildly, to spend millions of dollars against his rivals, particularly Mr. Rubio, whom it has spent more than $20 million attacking.

The prospect of the super PAC maintaining its assault on Mr. Rubio after the New Hampshire primary leaves many Republicans uneasy about Mr. Bush’s intentions. And Mr. Rubio’s supporters, cognizant of these concerns, began moving on Tuesday to stoke these fears.

“If Jeb doesn’t do well there, and he’s still got millions and millions to spend, does he stay around?” mused Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, a Rubio backer. “Who knows.”

But, Mr. Gardner noted, “more money has been spent attacking Republicans by fellow Republicans in this election than any cycle in the history of the party.”

It is not just supporters of Mr. Rubio who are dismayed. Some of Mr. Bush’s major donors, including those with long ties to the family, are also growing impatient, hoping he will not go past New Hampshire absent a strong finish here.

Graphic: Which States Cruz, Trump and Rubio Need to Win

Few are willing to say so publicly, and on a Tuesday conference call the campaign held for fund-raisers, they did not even get a chance to say so privately: The Bush aides running the call did not open it up to questions.

It is unclear what threshold Mr. Bush might feel he must reach to continue after the New Hampshire vote. But on the conference call and in talking points the campaign emailed late Monday night to supporters, Mr. Bush’s team pointed to surveys showing him in a statistical tie for second in New Hampshire.

The campaign also built up Mr. Bush’s effort to win the state, and trumpeted New Hampshire’s recent role in determining the Republican standard-bearer. (Left unmentioned was the 2000 primary here, in which Mr. Bush’s older brother, George W., lost in a landslide and still went on to claim the nomination.)

“The Granite State has long been the state voters look to in choosing the nominee and next president,” the staff wrote in the email to supporters, highlighting Mr. Bush’s endorsements and organizational strength.

In reality, Mr. Bush’s top advisers know Mr. Rubio’s finish in Iowa makes it harder for Mr. Bush to claim that he is the logical alternative to Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz. Yet he seems torn between focusing his fire on Mr. Rubio or Mr. Trump.

On Tuesday, his campaign began airing an unusually long two-minute ad in New Hampshire attacking Mr. Trump for insulting veterans, women and the disabled. And at a stop in Henniker, N.H., Mr. Bush aimed some of his most pointed language yet at Mr. Trump, who finished second in Iowa, calling him a “loser” with “deep insecurities.”

Yet on the same day Mr. Bush went so aggressively after Mr. Trump, he also sought to raise doubts about Mr. Rubio, incorporating Mr. Cruz for purposes of comparison.

“If you look at their records, they’re gifted in how they speak, but what about their life experience?” Mr. Bush said at Franklin Pierce University in Rindge, likening the two to President Obama, who was elected president after less than four years in the Senate. “Is there something in their past that would suggest they have the capability of making a tough decision?”

Yet there are signs Mr. Bush may still have some work to do.Speaking at the Hanover Inn near the Vermont border on Tuesday, Mr. Bush finished a fiery riff about protecting the country — “I won’t be out here blow-harding, talking a big game without backing it up,” he said — and was met with total silence.

“Please clap,” he said, sounding defeated.

The crowd laughed — and then, finally, clapped.

Anthony Joshua ready and waiting for Joseph Parker.

Kiwi heavyweight boxer Joseph Parker is a top-ranked world title contender for the first time.

The 24-year-old South Aucklander's trainer Kevin Barry tweeted on Friday afternoon that his young charge was now rated No 1 with the WBO.

"As of today Joseph Parker is now ranked #1 with the WBO #TEAMPARKER," Barry said to his 5,700 followers.

Parker, who went to 18-0 as a professional with a eighth-round technical knockout of American southpaw Jason Bergman in Samoa earlier this month, has leapfrogged English prospect Anthony Joshua and former longtime champion Wladimir Klitschko of the Ukraine into top spot.

ROBYN EDIE

Joseph Parker is now the No 1 ranked heavyweight contender with the WBO.

The rising Kiwi's climb may be the first solid step towards a fight many boxing fans have been eager to see for some time now.

It is understood Parker does not automatically become the mandatory challenger to British belt holder Tyson Fury and would have to fight No 2 contender Joshua to determine who claims the right for a shot at the title.

Heavyweight division gold medallist at the 2012 London Olympics, 26-year-old Joshua's record stands at 15-0.

Dean Lonergan of Duco Events, Parker's promoters, recently said Joshua was running scared of a fight with Parker and Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn replied that the Kiwi would have to get in line.
Ad Feedback

But a video emerged earlier this week of Joshua saying if Parker wanted to fight him, "he can come fight me".

"I've known about Parker since probably about 2009, when I was coming up in the amateurs," Joshua told iFL TV.

"Styles make fights, doesn't it? He's knocking out guys over in New Zealand, I'm knocking out guys in the UK - we come together and someone's going to get knocked out. That's just heavy-handed, fast, young prospects coming through the division."

Parker's next fight will be in Christchurch in late April, but an opponent is yet to be confirmed.

Controverisal Englishman Fury also holds the WBA belt after defeating Klitschko in November last year. The pair have signed for a rematch, but a date for the bout has not been finalised.

The two other champions in the division alongside Fury are Americans Deontay Wilder (WBC) and Charles Martin (IBF).

Parker is also ranked seventh with the WBC and IBF and 11th with the WBA.

For me this can be a greatest lesbian porn web page via the internet (nevertheless realsquirt is certainly close). All which is a downer in my situation is the females certainly not Communicate with one. As expected, because so many are and also the and don't speak out English language, that may be easy to undestand, however, with all the women who Will be able to speak out plus talk with The english language, it could be pleasant to listen for these talk to one another rather, particularly on the beginnings on the scenes.,
