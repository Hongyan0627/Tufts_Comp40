    Conditional jump depends on unitialized value Valgrind

        Hi, I am really lost here, I have airport class which should navigate planes, in its list to runways, with method move, theres a method prepare which changes the direction of flight to all planes, always before move is called, move just increments decrement x and y of plane in its list. But after calling two times in row airport->move(), I get screwed and I really dont know wheres the problem. Have I badly initiazed something? Iterator gets invalidated.

        Thanks for help.

        This is the method where it fails.
        When I call it once, no problem, after second call I get instead of normal number in cout<<after move<< s1 i get like 8795456

        Look at this code in airport::move().

        Code:
        ?
        1
        2
        3
        4
        5
        6
        7
        8
            
        if((*planeIteratorMoj)->move())
        {
            delete *planeIteratorMoj;
        }
         
        plane * p2 = (*planeIteratorMoj);
        int s1,w1;
        p2->getPosition(s1,w1);
        Immediately after deleting *planeIteratorMoj, this code dereferences *planeIteratorMoj.



        Logically, I would query the notion of an airport being able to move. Airports are often geographically fixed entities, that can't move. Either the function airport::move() is poorly named, or the logic of your design is deficient. Or both.

        p2 is there just for debbuging reasons,
        Airport has a list<plane*> and they have iterator planeIteratorMoj , so in the cycle i am calling function move in class plane, on instance of plane, if condition is true it means plane has landed and can be deleted.

        I want to ask you another thing, as I said I have list<plane*> where are correctly dynamically allocated instances of plane.
        If I have for cycle
        Code:

        for(planeIteratorMoj = planes.begin(); planeIteratorMoj!= planes.end(); planeIteratorMoj++)    {
                (*planeIteratorMoj)->move();
            }
        }

        As you can see function move in plane class is in my first topic, just increments internal variables of plane, are those changes correctly saved, so the plane inside a list has changed its position?

        Ironically, the p2 may be there for debugging reasons, but what you're doing with it introduces a bug. If you are going to add code for debugging purposes, you need to be sure it works.

        Take out the references to p2 and the vector, and your code is equivalent to
        Code:
        ?
        1
        2
            
        delete x;
        x->getPosition(s1,w1);     // undefined behaviour here!
        As to your question, if all you're doing in the loop is changing the state of elements, that is fine. It is operations that change the vector itself (eg resizing it) that you need to be careful of, due to potential of invalidating iterators.

        Incidentally, don't rely on everyone reading your previous posts. With the number of people here, and number of topics, not everyone will read everything. And not everyone will bother to remember every small detail of your posts anyway. While I remember responding to your previous thread, I certainly haven't remembered the exquisite details of the code you posted in it.

        Why are you using new in the first place?

        In your original example:

        Code:
        ?
        1
        2
        3
        4
            
        if((*planeIteratorMoj)->move())
        {
            delete *planeIteratorMoj;
        }
        You have a list of pointers to planes. This delete will delete the plane, but it won't remove the pointer from the list (i.e. list.size() will be the same).
        So on a subsquent call to airport::move(), the list of planes will have some pointers to freed memory.

        You probably want to delete the plane, and remove the pointer from the list. You can do that with list::erase list::erase - C++ Reference

        When you erase an element this way, the iterator to it becomes invalid, so you can't increment it. I'd suggest a while loop:
        Code:
        ?
        1
        2
        3
        4
        5
        6
        7
        8
            
        while (iter != thelist.end())
        {
           // do stuff
           if (condition to delete element)
               iter = thelist.erase(iter); 
           else
               iter++;
        }

        I'm surprised valgrind didn't give you a specific diagnostic about this: saying freed memory had been accessed.

        If you compile your code with debug information (-g), then valgrind can tell you the source line that caused a problem.

        This:

        Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
        ==26207== at 0x409601: plane::move() (in /home/xnovak11/Downloads/airport/main)
        I'd guess this is:
        Code:
        ?
        1
        2
        3
        4
            
        if(_hasLanded)
        {
            return false;
        }
        You don't seem to have set _hasLanded anywhere, at least not in the code you've posted.

        Also, you said:
        if condition is true it means plane has landed and can be deleted.
        which is the opposite of what this code is doing.

<cfloat> (float.h)
Characteristics of floating-point types
This header describes the characteristics of floating types for the specific system and compiler implementation used.

A floating-point number is composed of four elements:

    a sign: either negative or non-negative
    a base (or radix): which expresses the different numbers that can be represented with a single digit (2 for binary, 10 for decimal, 16 for hexadecimal, and so on...)
    a significand (or mantissa): which is a series of digits of the aforementioned base. The number of digits in this series is what is known as precision.
    an exponent (also known as characteristic, or scale): which represents the offset of the significand, affecting the value in the following way:
    value of floating-point = significand x baseexponent, with its corresponding sign.


Macro constants
The following panel shows the name of the different values defined in this header and their minimal or maximal values for all implementations (particula rimplementations may have values greater or smaller, as specified):

When a group of macros exists prefixed by FLT_, DBL_ and LDBL_, the one beginning with FLT_ applies to the float type, the one with DBL_ to double and the one with LDBL_ to long double.

name    value   stands for  expresses
FLT_RADIX   

2 or greater    

    RADIX   Base for all floating-point types (float, double and long double).
FLT_MANT_DIG
DBL_MANT_DIG
LDBL_MANT_DIG       MANTissa DIGits Precision of significand, i.e. the number of digits that conform the significand.
FLT_DIG
DBL_DIG
LDBL_DIG    6 or greater
10 or greater
10 or greater   DIGits  Number of decimal digits that can be rounded into a floating-point and back without change in the number of decimal digits.
FLT_MIN_EXP
DBL_MIN_EXP
LDBL_MIN_EXP        MINimum EXPonent    Minimum negative integer value for the exponent that generates a normalized floating-point number.
FLT_MIN_10_EXP
DBL_MIN_10_EXP
LDBL_MIN_10_EXP -37 or smaller
-37 or smaller
-37 or smaller  MINimum base-10 EXPonent    Minimum negative integer value for the exponent of a base-10 expression that would generate a normalized floating-point number.
FLT_MAX_EXP
DBL_MAX_EXP
LDBL_MAX_EXP        MAXimum EXPonent    Maximum integer value for the exponent that generates a normalized floating-point number.
FLT_MAX_10_EXP
DBL_MAX_10_EXP
LDBL_MAX_10_EXP 37 or greater
37 or greater
37 or greater   MAXimum base-10 EXPonent    Maximum integer value for the exponent of a base-10 expression that would generate a normalized floating-point number.
FLT_MAX
DBL_MAX
LDBL_MAX    1E+37 or greater
1E+37 or greater
1E+37 or greater    MAXimum Maximum finite representable floating-point number.
FLT_EPSILON
DBL_EPSILON
LDBL_EPSILON    1E-5 or smaller
1E-9 or smaller
1E-9 or smaller EPSILON Difference between 1 and the least value greater than 1 that is representable.
FLT_MIN
DBL_MIN
LDBL_MIN    1E-37 or smaller
1E-37 or smaller
1E-37 or smaller    MINimum Minimum representable floating-point number.
FLT_ROUNDS      ROUND   Rounding behavior. Possible values:
-1 undetermined
 0 toward zero
 1 to nearest
 2 toward positive infinity
 3 toward negative infinity
Applies to all floating-point types (float, double and long double).
FLT_EVAL_METHOD     EVALuation METHOD   Properties of the evaluation format. Possible values:
-1 undetermined
 0 evaluate just to the range and precision of the type
 1 evaluate float and double as double, and long double as long double.
 2 evaluate all as long double Other negative values indicate an implementation-defined behavior.
Applies to all floating-point types (float, double and long double).
DECIMAL_DIG     DECIMAL DIGits  Number of decimal digits that can be rounded into a floating-point type and back again to the same decimal digits, without loss in precision.

Compatibility
FLT_EVAL_METHOD and DECIMAL_DIG are defined for libraries complying with the C standard of 1999 or later (which only includes the C++ standard since 2011: C++11).

    Conditional jump depends on unitialized value Valgrind

        Hi, I am really lost here, I have airport class which should navigate planes, in its list to runways, with method move, theres a method prepare which changes the direction of flight to all planes, always before move is called, move just increments decrement x and y of plane in its list. But after calling two times in row airport->move(), I get screwed and I really dont know wheres the problem. Have I badly initiazed something? Iterator gets invalidated.

        Thanks for help.

        Valgrind Stacktrace
        Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)

        When I call it once, no problem, after second call I get instead of normal number in cout<<after move<< s1 i get like 8795456

        Look at this code in airport::move().

        Code:
        ?
        1
        2
        3
        4
        5
        6
        7
        8
            
        if((*planeIteratorMoj)->move())
        {
            delete *planeIteratorMoj;
        }
         
        plane * p2 = (*planeIteratorMoj);
        int s1,w1;
        p2->getPosition(s1,w1);
        Immediately after deleting *planeIteratorMoj, this code dereferences *planeIteratorMoj.



        Logically, I would query the notion of an airport being able to move. Airports are often geographically fixed entities, that can't move. Either the function airport::move() is poorly named, or the logic of your design is deficient. Or both.

        p2 is there just for debbuging reasons,
        Airport has a list<plane*> and they have iterator planeIteratorMoj , so in the cycle i am calling function move in class plane, on instance of plane, if condition is true it means plane has landed and can be deleted.

        I want to ask you another thing, as I said I have list<plane*> where are correctly dynamically allocated instances of plane.
        If I have for cycle
        Code:

        for(planeIteratorMoj = planes.begin(); planeIteratorMoj!= planes.end(); planeIteratorMoj++)    {
                (*planeIteratorMoj)->move();
            }
        }

        As you can see function move in plane class is in my first topic, just increments internal variables of plane, are those changes correctly saved, so the plane inside a list has changed its position?

        Ironically, the p2 may be there for debugging reasons, but what you're doing with it introduces a bug. If you are going to add code for debugging purposes, you need to be sure it works.

        Take out the references to p2 and the vector, and your code is equivalent to
        Code:
        ?
        1
        2
            
        delete x;
        x->getPosition(s1,w1);     // undefined behaviour here!
        As to your question, if all you're doing in the loop is changing the state of elements, that is fine. It is operations that change the vector itself (eg resizing it) that you need to be careful of, due to potential of invalidating iterators.

        Incidentally, don't rely on everyone reading your previous posts. With the number of people here, and number of topics, not everyone will read everything. And not everyone will bother to remember every small detail of your posts anyway. While I remember responding to your previous thread, I certainly haven't remembered the exquisite details of the code you posted in it.

        In your original example:

        Code:
        ?
        1
        2
        3
        4
            
        if((*planeIteratorMoj)->move())
        {
            delete *planeIteratorMoj;
        }
        You have a list of pointers to planes. This delete will delete the plane, but it won't remove the pointer from the list (i.e. list.size() will be the same).
        So on a subsquent call to airport::move(), the list of planes will have some pointers to freed memory.

        You probably want to delete the plane, and remove the pointer from the list. You can do that with list::erase list::erase - C++ Reference

        When you erase an element this way, the iterator to it becomes invalid, so you can't increment it. I'd suggest a while loop:
        Code:
        ?
        1
        2
        3
        4
        5
        6
        7
        8
            
        while (iter != thelist.end())
        {
           // do stuff
           if (condition to delete element)
               iter = thelist.erase(iter); 
           else
               iter++;
        }

        I'm surprised valgrind didn't give you a specific diagnostic about this: saying freed memory had been accessed.

        If you compile your code with debug information (-g), then valgrind can tell you the source line that caused a problem.

        This:

        Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
        ==26207== at 0x409601: plane::move() (in /home/xnovak11/Downloads/airport/main)
        I'd guess this is:
        Code:
        ?
        1
        2
        3
        4
            
        if(_hasLanded)
        {
            return false;
        }
        You don't seem to have set _hasLanded anywhere, at least not in the code you've posted.

        Also, you said:
        if condition is true it means plane has landed and can be deleted.
        which is the opposite of what this code is doing.

Summary of the Assignment

In this assignment you will design, build and test two application programs and one supporting file input routine. The first program reports the average brightness of an image file. The second program reports similarities in file data, and it uses an input routine called readaline that you will implement. That input routine must conform to an interface that we provide.

The primary specifications for these programs are contained in the sections Part A (Brightness), Part B (Read a Line) and Part C (Similarities in Files) below.

Note that for Part B, you get partial credit for a limited implementation that only handles short input lines. We strongly urge you to implement that limited version first, then go on and complete Part C, and only if you have time go back to enhance Part B for full credit. You will lose much more credit for doing a poor job on Part C than for failing to handle long lines in Part B.
Background and preparation

The sections below give information about the purpose of this assignment, as well as other background you should understand before starting work.
Purpose of this assignment

This assignment has several goals:

    To teach you to work in pairs on assignments that are more challenging than you have encountered before
    To help you make the transition from C++ programming to the kind of C programming we expect in COMP 40
    To start you thinking about the interface as a unit of design
    To give you practice in identifying interfaces and existing implementations that can help you solve problems
    To give you experience reading and conforming exactly to specifications, such as the those contained in this document
    To start to convince you that writing good test cases, not just for correct or obvious input but also for edge cases and error cases, is as important as writing good program code
    To give you experience teaching yourself about languages like C, systems like Linux, and system features like stdin, fopen, etc.
    To give you experience working with a partner to design, document, implement and test a computer program
    To introduce you to multiple representations of numbers

We understand that assignments like this will take you out of your comfort zone. When you read these instructions there will be many things that at first you won't understand. Not everything you need to know will be explained to you in detail.

These are the challenges that professional programmers and computer scientists face every day. Stick with it, figure things out, use the system documentation, get help. You may not succeed completely at everything we ask of you even by the end of the assignment, although it's certainly possible and many students do. Experience shows that over time almost all of you will learn not just to build programs like these, but also to teach yourself about the language features and tools that you need.
C vs. C++, and Hanson's Interfaces and Implementations

The C language is for the most part a proper subset of C++. Indeed, C came first and was only many years later extended to add object orientation, parameterized types and other higher-level features features. Note that both languages are very widely used to this day.

So, why C in comp 40? A primary goal of COMP 40 is to teach you how computers work, and to show you how modern software uses the hardware on which it runs. You will find that C, being a smaller and simpler language, translates much more directly to hardware primitives. Furthermore, working in C allows us to build ourselves many of the higher-level features whose implementation is hidden in the runtimes of more complex languages. So, using C we learn more about the internal workings of languages like C++ (and Java and Python, etc.)

Although C itself does not include the sorts of high-level structures like Lists, Sets, or hash-based Tables/Maps you might find in C++ or Java, we in COMP 40 give you implementations by Dave Hanson. We expect you to use these rather than building your own, and we offer them as examples of interesting, well-written C code from which you can learn. There is an online Quick Reference guide at http://ciibook.webhop.net/pdf/quickref.pdf Note: the Hanson Array class is not available for use in COMP 40, and is not needed for this assignment. Of course, you are also encouraged where appropriate to use C language structs, arrays, etc.

You will find some useful information for new C programmers in the section below titled: General advice for new C programmers Although we will give you some hints like these about the differences between C and C++, we also expect to to teach yourselves many of the details. Other good sources include the books that we have recommended, online resources, etc. Help each other learn! In COMP 40 you must not share work on your solutions, but you are welcome to work with your fellow students to learn new languages and technologies.
Setting up your environment

    To add the course binaries to your execution path, run

    use comp40

    You may want to put this command in your .cshrc or your .profile:

    use -q comp40

    Without the -q, you may have difficulties with scp, ssh, git, and rsync.

    To get started:

      git clone /comp/40/git/filesnpix

    You will get two files: compile and Makefile. You should leave the compile script alone: it's a program that just runs make. It's there for legacy reasons as we transition the course from compile scripts to makefiles. Use make and the Makefile to build your programs. Depending on how you structure your code, you may have to make minor modifications to the Makefile so that it will compile and link together the correct source modules for your projects. The handout A simple introduction to Compile Scripts and Makefiles (concentrate on the Makefile part) should give you the information you need. In later projects you will likely have to make more extensive modifications to Makefiles, so you should read and learn about them so you understand what they're doing. The Makefile for Lab 0 and this one are intended as gentle introductions: we will gradually make use of more sophisticated features of make as the semester progresses. (You may want to compare this one to the Lab 0 Makefile to see what I mean.)

Getting started with Hanson's Interfaces and Implementations

For Part C: Similarities in files you will need several of the C interfaces and implementations David Hanson. You'll also need a general understanding of Hansons conventions, exceptions for assertions in error handling, etc. for Part A: Brightness.

    To get started, read Chapters 1 and 2 (pages 1–31) of Hanson's book.
    To learn what Hanson has built for you, skim the beginnings of the relevant chapters: pages 45–52, pages 33–34, pages 103–107, pages 115–118 (pages 118–125 recommended), pages 137–140, pages 161–164, pages 171–173, and the first sections of Chapters 15 and 16, which I don't have the page numbers for. 

Other preparation

Be sure you have read the course policies, especially notes on the general expectations for COMP 40 homework (including all subsections!), collaboration, guidelines for pair programming and the course coding standards. Note that terminology definitions (e.g. for the term Checked Runtime Error), and the expectations set in the sections on Homework Grades and Errors, Exceptions, Output, Valgrind and Grades etc. are implicitly part of the specifications for all COMP 40 homework, including this one.

We emphasize again that pair programming is required for all COMP 40 assignments. It is your responsibility to understand and abide by the COMP 40 policies on pair programming. If you have not been assigned a partner or do not have permission to work separately (such permission is very rare), please contact the instructor immediately! You will get no credit if you work alone unless you have permission.
Part A: Brightness of a grayscale image
Please write a C program brightness that prints the average brightness of a grayscale image. Every pixel in a grayscale image has a brightness between 0 and 1, where 0 is black and 1 is as bright as possible.
Specification

Print to standard output a single newline-terminated line containing the average brightness of the supplied image. The brightness should be printed in decimal notation with exactly one digit before the decimal point and three digits after the decimal point.

The program takes at most one argument:

    If an argument is given, it should be the name of a portable graymap file (in pgm format).
    If no argument is given, brightness reads from standard input, which should contain a portable graymap.
    If more than one argument is given, brightness halts with an error (see below).
    If a portable graymap is promised but not delivered, brightness halts with an error (see below). 

Where the specification above requires that you halt with an error, you have two choices:

    You may print an error message on stderr and exit your program using exit(EXIT_FAILURE) from stdlib.h
    You may exit with a failed assertion or other Hanson-style Checked Runtime Exception (see explanation of CREs in the Hanson book)

When exiting due to such an error you must not produce any output on stdout.
Examples of Brightness in Use

    Here are two photos:
    black cat in a coal cellar at midnight  polar bear in a snowstorm
    Black cat in coal cellar    Polar bear in snowstorm

    If cellar.pgm is a picture of a black cat in a coal cellar at midnight, and if bear.jpg is a picture of a polar bear in an snowstorm, then output should look something like this:

    sunfire33{noah}: brightness cellar.pgm
    0.000
    sunfire33{noah}: djpeg -grayscale bear.jpg | brightness
    0.972
    sunfire33{noah}: 

    The first example takes its input from a file named on the command line, and the second example takes its input from standard input, as part of a Unix pipeline. 

My solution to this problem takes fewer than 35 lines of C code.
Help with image files
We provide code to help you read image files; you will find the Pnmrdr interface in /comp/40/include and the implementation in /comp/40/lib64. If you use the supplied Makefile, these should be found automatically when your code needs them. Creating a Pnmrdr_T will read the graymap header for you, and from the header you can compute how many pixels are in the image. (You should read exactly as many pixels as are there—no more, no fewer.) Don't forget that the brightness of each pixel is represented as a scaled integer, as described in the Pnmrdr interface.
Getting images
You can get images to play with by using one or more of the following programs:

    djpeg (use the -grayscale option)
    pngtopnm
    pstopnm
    ppmtopgm 

Problem analysis and advice
The main issues here are:

    In place of much of the C++ technique you already know, you have new C techniques to learn. The ideas are all similar, like old wine; C is a new bottle.
    You will have to read and understand the interface for Pnmrdr, and you will have to understand a little bit about the pgm image format.
    You will have to do something appropriate if somebody hands you input that is not a portable graymap.

    There is a subtlety here: we are asking you to use Pnm_rdr to read image files, and we are also sending a strong signal that your programs should be careful to check for and handle erroneous input. What if Pnm_rdr fails to detect an error in what is supposed to be an image file? Answer: for this assignment and others in COMP 40, don't worry about it. The whole purpose of using Pnm_rdr is to hide from you details of how the image file is represented on disk. Therefore, it's inappropriate to ask you to do more checking than Pnm_rdr does.

    Of course, if this were a commercial program that might not be good enough: you would have to do due diligence to check that Pnm_rdr was indeed detecting all significant errors. For our purposes, just trust that it does.
    You are still responsible for making sure that when Pnm_rdr does detect an error in the image file, your program reports the error in an appropriate way. Maybe or maybe not this will involve writing nontrivial code.
    You will have to understand the compile-time and link-time options that gcc needs to work with the Pnmrdr interface (-I/comp/40/include and -L/comp/40/lib64 -lpnmrdr). A good start would be to understand the Makefile you received for this assignment (and you can also look in A simple introduction to Compile Scripts and Makefiles, which is for a previous version of this assignment, but is carefully explained there).
    To get the Makefile for this program, you must (if you didn't already):

      git clone /comp/40/git/filesnpix

    This will create a filesnpix directory with the compile script in it.
    You'll have to deal with two representations of real numbers between 0 and 1. 

There is also an important issue of style:

    When using an enumeration literal such as Pnmrdr_gray, refer to it by name, not by number. 

Part B: Read a line

Please create a single source file named readaline.c. Within that file you must:

    Include the header file readaline.h using #include. (The header file itself is provided for you in /comp/40/include, which is in the include path if you use the provided Makefile.)
    Implement a single function named readaline, conforming to the function declaration in the header file, which is:

    size_t readaline(FILE *inputfp, char **datap);

We will separately test and grade the correctness of your implementation of this function. You will also use the function in Part C below, so problems with this function can also affect your grade on that. Test carefully (and then test again!)

Do not make a copy of readaline.h in your project directory! Your submission will not be accepted if you do. If your compiles fail when including that header file there is almost surely something wrong with your Makefile.
readaline specification

The purpose of this function is to read a single line of input from file inputfp, which is presumed to have been opened for reading. As is common in specifications for computer programs and interfaces, we carefully define some terms, and then use those to specify the behavior of readaline:

    The term character refers to any of the 256 characters of ISO Latin-1 extended ASCII. The bytes in the input file are interpreted as such characters.
    The characters comprising each file are grouped into zero or more lines as follows:
        Each line contains at least one character
        New lines begin at the start of the file, and after each newline character ('\n')
        Each newline character is included in the line that it terminates
    Each invocation of readaline retrieves the next unread line in the file. The characters comprising the line are placed into a contiguous array of bytes, and *datap is set to the address of of the first byte. readaline returns the number of bytes in the line.
    The array of bytes is allocated by readaline using malloc (or the related allocation functions described in man 3 malloc.) It is the responsibility of the caller of readaline to free the array using free.
    readaline leaves the file seek pointer at the first (i. e., unread) character of the following line (if any) or at EOF
    If readaline is called when there are no more lines to be read, it sets *datap to NULL and returns 0.
    readaline terminates with a Checked Runtime Error in any of the following situations:
        Either or both of the supplied arguments is NULL
        An error is encountered reading from the file
        Memory allocation fails
    readaline must not cause memory leaks. That is, it must not leave allocated any dynamically acquired memory other than that returned to the caller through *datap. 

For handling input lines you MUST NOT use the system library routines getline or getdelim, and you must not consult the man pages or other documentation relating to them. Reason: we want you to learn to do the work of reading input lines yourself.
Partial credit

For full credit, your readaline implementation must support input lines of any size. Significant partial credit is available if you support input files in which no line exceeds 200 characters in length, including any new line character. If you read a line that is longer than your implementation can handle, your readaline MUST write the message:

readaline: input line too long\n

to stderr and must immediate cause the program to exit with status code = 4 by calling the system function exit(4) (You learned to call exit() in Part A.)
Hints

A few hints:

    The datap parameter to readaline is a call by reference (CBR) parameter, i.e., it's used for function output.

    Analogy: “Please slip the address of the party under my door.” In this case, there are two locations involved: the location of the party, and the location where we want location of the party to be stored (under the door).

    Application: For this function, the caller wants access to the data in the next line. The readaline function will collect the data and store it somewhere (that's where the party is). The caller is asking readaline to store the location of the data in a location it has access to. That's what *datap refers to.

    Draw a stack diagram. Stack diagrams are not analogies or “the way you think about how functions work”; they are precise descriptions of what actually happens in the computer. Therefore, you want to get these right, and there is a definite right way to draw these. Please ask the course staff for help, but try to draw it out first. Then you can explain your thinking to a member of the course staff, and we can applaud your insight or correct misunderstandings as appropriate.
    Under the covers, Hanson's ALLOC and NEW macros use malloc. So, you have a choice: if you are more comfortable using malloc and friends directly, go ahead. If you prefer the extra error-checking provided by Hanson's macros, you may use them. (FWIW: Norman Ramsey prefers Hanson's versions, Noah Mendelsohn is generally more comfortable with malloc. Either will get you full credit if used properly.)
    You will want to come up with some strategy for carefully testing your readaline function. Of course, you could just use it in your Part C simlines program and hope everything works, but we think you'll find that debugging is actually much harder that way. When something goes wrong (as it almost surely will), you will have to look everywhere to find the problem. Therefore: we strongly urge you to come up with a strategy for carefully testing readaline by itself.
    Question: according to the specification, is there any file you cannot read in its entirety by repeatedly calling your readaline function? Think about it. Why or why not? (You do not need to submit your answer.) Make sure your implementation can handle every file that the specification requires. Design your test cases accordingly.
    Handling lines of arbitrary size may be trickier than you think. DO NOT spend all your time trying to implement that at the cost of not getting to Part C. As noted above, you will get significant partial credit for both parts B and C if you can handle lines of at least 200 characters (you will use your readaline implementation in part C). We suggest you plan for longer lines, but for a start support only the 200 character minimum. Go on to part C and get that running. If you get all of that working, go back and extend readaline to handle longer lines. In principle, your Part C program should immediately start working with longer lines too!
    The size_t return type is an integer large enough to hold the number of bytes in the largest supported file on our Linux system. It is a standard type defined in stddef.h and used for this purpose by system library routines such as fread. 

Part C: Similarities in files

You are to write a program named simlines, the purpose of which is to read one or more data files to detect lines in the files that are similar to each other. Below we give you a detailed specification of what the program must do. Informally, it reads through one or more files looking for cases in which two or more lines contain the same words in the same order. It produces on standard output a report with a section for each such list of words, indicating which line numbers in which files contain those words.
simlines specification overview

The specification for simlines is as follows:

    The simlines program accepts zero or more command line arguments, each of which is the name of a file
    The program identifies all cases in which two or more lines in any of the input files are "similar" to each other, where similarity is determined by the definition below
    Similarities are reported if they occur within any single file and/or if lines in more than one of the files are similar
    The program writes its results to standard output in exactly the form specified for output below
    The simlines program raises a Checked Runtime Error if any of the following occur:
        Any one or more of the named input files cannot be opened
        An error is encountered reading from any of the input files
        Memory cannot be allocated using malloc

    If any of these situations arise, the program produces no output on stdout. The output on stderr must be only what is produced by the default Checked Runtime Error exception handler.
    If the same file is named more than once on the command line, then it is read and processed repeatedly, once for each command line reference. Note that this is very likely to result in similarities being detected and reported, since files are mostly similar to themselves!
    You MUST use your implementation of readaline from part B to read the data. If you are using a partial credit version of readaline that supports input lines of limited length, then you must rely on the error handling specified in part B to exit from simlines if an unsupported long input line is encountered.

Definition of line similarity

The following gives the rules for determining whether two lines are similar:

    The terms character and line have the same definition as in the specifications for readaline
    A word character is any of lowercase 'a' - 'z'; uppercase 'A' - 'Z'; the digit characters '0' - '9', and the underscore character '_' (which is ASCII code 95 decimal). All other characters are non-word characters
    Any contiguous grouping of word characters is a word. As common sense would suggest the term always refers to the largest possible groupings, thus the line:

        'abc  def'


    contains the two words abc and def, but not the words ab, ef or a.
    Thus any line contains zero or more words, optionally preceded, followed by and/or separated by non-word characters.
    Two lines are similar if and only if they contain the same words in the same order. Note that non-word characters are significant only as separators. Thus, the following lines are all similar to each other:

        'abc  def'
        'abc    def'
        '  abc    def '
        'abc,def'

    Lines containing no words (including empty lines) are not similar to other lines containing no words 

Simlines output specification

We define the term match group to refer to any set of two or more lines in the input file(s) that are similar. Such lines contain the same words in the same order, and we refer to that ordered list of words as the matching words list.

The output written to stdout by simlines must conform exactly to the following specification:

    There is one output section for each match group.
    If there is more than one match group, the corresponding output sections are separated from each other by a single additional newline (\n). The sections may appear in any order.
    If a match group contains n matches, then the corresponding output section consists of n+1 newline-terminated lines:
        The first line of each output group contains the list of match words, separated from each other (if there is more than one) by a single space '  ' character.
        For each match, a line consisting of:
            The name of the file in which the match occurred, exactly as specified in the corresponding commandline argument. The name is printed left justified (i.e. starting at the beginning of the line), and padded to the right with blanks to fill a total of 20 characters. If the filename is longer than 20 characters, then it is written in its entirety, but with no additional padding.
            A single additional space (typically the 21st character, unless the file name was long)
            A right justified seven digit integer giving the line number in which the match occurred. Line numbering is 1-based, i.e. the first line in the file is line 1, the second line 2, etc. No leading zeros are included in the line numbers.
        Within a match group the lines corresponding to each match are written in order. That is all matches in the file named by the first command line argument appear ahead of those in the files that follow. If there are multiple matches in a single file, they are written in order of increasing line number.
    As noted above, the same file named repeatedly on the command line results in no special processing: the file is read repeatedly, almost surely resulting in similar lines in the output, and those lines must be reported in order according to where the file references were in the command line. E.g. the command

    simlines testfile otherfile testfile

    might well result in an output group like this:

    hello world
    testfile-------------------2
    otherfile------------------7
    testfile-------------------2

    If testfile contained the words "hello world" on line 2, and otherfile contain the same words on line 7. (The light gray dashes in the sample output above are spaces in the actual output of simlines; the dashes are shown above to make the spaces easier to count.)

A consequence of the above rules is that simlines produces no output if there are no matches.
Hints

Here are some hints that may help you in writing your simlines program:

    Writing that left-justified 20 character filename is easy if you know how to use printf. Look online for hints about printing fixed width left-justified strings or ask for help. If you do this right, all the formatting including correct handling of very long filenames, the proper right justification of the line number, etc. can easily be handled by a single printf.
    If you read carefully you will note that, except for allowing the output groups to be written in any order, the specification determines character by character exactly what your output must be
    Be careful! If you do not exactly match the specification, you will not get credit. Note that formatting errors tend to impact all of your output, and can easily result in failure of multiple tests or even of all tests ... read the specification and check your output carefully!
    There is no additional deduction for Part C if your readaline supports only lines of limited length, as long as your simlines correctly exits when confronted with a long line that it cannot handle. If your simlines does not exit in that way, then simlines will be graded on its handling of long as well as short lines. 

Performance target
Your simlines program should perform well on inputs resulting in at least 10000 match groups with up to hundreds of thousands of lines of input. (Due to limitations in the implementations of Hansons libraries, if you use the data structures we think likely, you may find performance slows dramatically if the number of match groups grows much larger than 10000.) By perform well, we mean completing in under 20 seconds or so on an unloaded server, if the output is redirected to a file or to /dev/null (If you look up /dev/null you'll find that it is a pseudo-file that throws away whatever is written to it... writing to that won't let you check your output, but it's a good way to time your program without waiting for hundreds of thousands of lines of output to be written to your display or even to a real file.) Of course, for shorter inputs of hundreds of lines with tens of matches, your program should respond more or less instantaneously.
Problem analysis and advice
This problem boils down to simple string processing and standard data structures.

    The key to solving the simlines problem is to think very carefully about the data structures you will be creating and about how those data structures will result in a solution. Ask yourself questions like the following. Note that these overlap a lot with the information we ask you to provide us in your Design Document
        What data structure(s) will you create to represent a match group?
        How will you efficiently find out whether a given line from an input file belongs in a match group?
        If it does, what information will you retain about the match?
        For which of these are Hanson's datatype implementations such as List, Table, Set, Sequence, etc. useful, or when is it more appropriate to use C-language arrays, structs, etc.?
        Which data, if any, should be converted to Hanson Atoms, and why?
        When the time comes to write out a match group, how will you write the matches in order? (Hint: you should not try to sort them using a sort routine...there are much easier and more efficient ways if you use the right data structures. Be very careful to check the ordering rules for the various data structures you might be tempted to use!)
        How is the memory for each of your data structures allocated? Do you have a way to free it to avoid memory leaks (remember, there is no way to free the memory for Atoms, and you will not be penalized for using Atoms... all other memory leaks must be avoided.)

    Draw pictures! Take some interesting but small test cases and dry out in detail a picture of all your data structures and how they connect to each other. Once you have this picture absolutely clear and correct, organizing your code and then writing and debugging it will become much easier.
    We've said it before,and you'll hear us say it again and again in COMP 40: you will be tempted to put the majority of your time into designing and coding your program. You'll be tempted to build all or most of it, test the whole thing, and then try to find where the bugs are. This will almost surely waste a lot of your time! When you test all of your work together, the bugs could be almost anywhere. A bug in one routine might not cause an immediate crash, but might produce bad results because your program to fail after executing hundreds of thousands of more lines of code.

    The way to avoid this is to put as much energy into your test plan as you get into the design and and coding of your solution. Find ways to test individual pieces of your code. Create test cases explore not just the obvious paths, but the unusual ones.
    C strings are different from C++ strings, and C's string library can be tricky to use properly. Make absolutely certain you understand the role of the NULL character '\0' in the termination of C strings. If you just code without understanding this, you are in for hours of frustration. Hanson offers some string processing libraries that you may (or might not) find helpful...my solution does not use them, but Norman Ramsey did use them in the solution to a somewhat similar problem given in years past.
    When it comes to string comparison, what you know is wrong. In C, writing

      if (s1 == s2) { ... }

    does not compare equality of two strings—it compares equality of pointers. To compare two strings for equality, you must write

      if (strcmp(s1, s2) == 0) { ... }

    Many old hands write this code more briefly:

      if (!strcmp(s1, s2)) { ... }

    but the briefer style requires a sharp eye for the exclamation mark and is based on a pun: strcmp() returns 0 when the strings match, and an if will regard that as false.

    We prefer to make tests involving integers that don't actually stand for booleans explicit, so use the first form.
    Hanson's Atom interface maps equal strings to identical pointers, so pointer equality is OK on strings created with Atom_string or Atom_new. To use strings as keys or for similar purposes with Hanson's data structures, you must use the Atom interface. (When using a string as a value (as opposed to a key), then use of Atom's is optional.)

    Note: Hansons's Array data structure is not available for use in COMP 40. As you will see in the next assignment, we have developed an improved (or at least more interesting) version that we will introduce then. You should not need to use Hansons's array for this first homework. (Of course, C character strings are C arrays, so you will definitely use C arrays when working with those.)
    Don't forget to run valgrind on your code

Repeat: the data structures are already built for you; your job is to figure out which ones will be useful. We are looking for a clean, straightforward design.
Part C (DESIGN): Simlines Design

DUE EARLY! (see course calendar)
Design overview

The key to doing a good job on any program of significant complexity is to think thoroughly in advance two related questions:

    How will data in the program be represented and interconnected?
    How will the program logic be organized, and how will the computation be done? 

For many programs, the first question is the more fundamental: you will find that if you have a sound and well considered approach to representing the data in your program, the logic and the program structure will easily follow. Thus, the heart of a software design lies in its representation of data.

There are several reasons why it's useful not just to think through, but also to write down the answers to the above questions before writing your program logic. These include:

    Writing down your design will tend to make you think it through more carefully. You will do a better job of discovering whether you have anticipated all the possibilities.
    Once your design is written down, it will be easy for you to have others review it (in the case of COMP 40, you will develop your design with your partner, and you may show it to teaching assistants and instructors, but to no one else)
    In COMP 40, we ask you to submit a design document early enough that we can give you some comments while your program is still under development. Often, we can warn you of design problems before they derail you.

It is crucial to cover not just the obvious main path considerations for your program; you need to consider all the different inputs and circumstances that your program has to handle properly.
Design document specifics

Because documentation is such an essential part of COMP 40, we offer a number detailed guides on the course referenced page. Included are some general guidance to preparing documentation, as well as specific guides for design documents for entire programs and for new abstract data types.

For this assignment, we are making things simpler and asking you only for the following subset of the information we might normally expect for a new program. In the design document you submit you must:

    Identify what data structures you will need to compute simlines and what each data structure will contain
    Hanson's data structures are polymorphic, so you will have to explain what each void * pointer will point to
    Please describe the invariant that will hold when your simlines program is partway through reading input lines.
    Based on these two explanations, explain briefly how you will determine the simlines groups once all input has been read and explain how you will use your match group data structures to write the required output sections .
    Explain in detail your testing plan for both part B and part C You'll get essentially no credit for saying "I plan to try it with lots of inputs and see if it works". We need to know how you plan to test (e.g. readaline is a function, so you'll have to explain who calls it), and you should give us some sense of the range of test cases you'll be trying. 

Suggested order of work

This is a big assignment, and it's your first assignment. You will need to balance working in an orderly way with looking ahead so you can plan your time and overlap thinking about some of the harder problems in Part C with some of the development work for Part A and Part B. As described below, you will need to get far enough on the design of Part C to submit your design document on time.

The exact order in which you will want to do all this will depend a bit on what you already know and on your working style, but something like this will work for most of you:

    Read all of this instruction document several times. Try to make sure you understand what is being asked of you, and if you don't, ask on Piazza or talk to a TA in the labs.
    Make an annotated copy of these instructions that you and your partner can share (either on paper or online), noting things you don't understand, and indicating specific areas that will require research, design work, etc. Note in your annotations everything that you are required to submit, and every specific case that you must cover. We are not asking you to hand in your annotated copy, but you can use it as a valuable checklist as you work through the assignment.
    Make a tentative schedule and update it as things change. You can base it on the following if you like. Plan for trouble! Things will almost surely go wrong. If you aim to have your work done a day or two early, then the pressure will not be so great if you have a nasty bug.
    Your main early activities should include:
        Learning all the technologies you will need to solve these problems so that you can make good design decisions. If necessary, experiment! Almost surely, you will want to write little test programs that open files, read data, and maybe create a Hanson data structure or two, just to make sure you know how. Your annotated instructions will be a good guide to what to learn first (e.g. image file formats and Pnm_rdr for your brightness program)
        Setting up your development environment, as described above
    Then, get started designing Part A: Brightness (remember: both partners must be working together on all aspects of the design and implementation and testing … you must not split the work!)
    Before you implement brightness, make a detailed test plan for it. Include in your schedule the time to develop the test cases and to do the actual testing.
    Start working on the implementation of Part A: Brightness. Try to finish brightness in the first half of the time available for this assignment. Part B and especially Part C are more time-consuming, so leave plenty of time for them!
    As you start to turn the corner on brightness, or if you are getting short on time, begin preparing your design document for Part C: Similarities in files. You probably won't make good progress on your first try, as you'll realize that you need to look more deeply into some of the Hanson interfaces and what they can do for you.
    Make a detailed test plan for Part B (Read a Line) and for .Part C: Similarities in files (we need an outline of both test plans in your design document.)
    Be sure to submit your design document by the deadline (or up to two days late if you are using tokens — if you use tokens for your design document you may not get feedback in time to be useful for your implementation)
    Design, implement and thoroughly test the partial credit version of Part B (Read a Line). Do not rely on your simlines program as the only test framework for readaline.
    With luck, around this time you'll be getting back our comments on your Part C design document. Either way, as soon as you finish Part B, start refine your design for and then code simlines (part C).
    Test, test, and test some more.
    If you have time, go back and extend your readaline to handle long lines. Thoroughly unit test readaline and, only once it works reliably, relink your simlines with it. Before you start modifying readaline to handle long lines, be sure to save a copy of the source for your simple implementation! That way, if you get in trouble with the enhancement you'll still have something that works. Without that, you will have neither a working Part B nor Part C!
    As you get ready to submit, read carefully the section on Organizing and submitting your solutions. 

To review: the design document covers the design of part C only and also testing plans for both part B and part C. Your design document is due before the rest of the assignment. Parts A and B do not require a written design. The full assignment (parts A, B, and C) is due a few days later. Having working versions of all parts with only short line support in Part B will earn you more credit then a full version of Part B but missing or buggy Part C. See the course calendar for specific due dates.
Deadlines and tokens

Like all programming assignments for this class, the programming parts of this assignment are due one minute before midnight on the day indicated in the course calendar. You may turn in assignments up to 48 hours after the due date, which will cost you one or two extension tokens. If you wish not to spend an extension token, then when midnight arrives submit whatever you have. We are very willing to give partial credit.

If you spend an extension token on any part of the assignment, it automatically applies to all parts of the assignment. I.e. submit either your design or your code a day late you use a token; submit them both a day late and it's still only one token total. Of course, if either is two days late, that's two tokens.

You may resubmit until the original deadline (i.e. not counting token extensions) and we will grade the latest version available at the deadline. What you may not do is to submit before the deadline, then decide to use tokens and resubmit. Reason: at the deadline we gather your work and start grading. If you resubmit, we will likely not notice, and would then have to regrade. If you are planning to use tokens, please do not submit. If you have an unusual problem, please email comp40-staff@cs.tufts.edu.
Organizing and submitting your solutions

You will make two submissions to complete this assignment. Several days before the final submission, you will submit a design document. At the end of your work, you will make a final submission that includes your code.

Only one partner makes each submission, and the same partner should submit both the design and the final code submission. When you submit, you will identify your partner.
Submitting your design document

By the design deadline, submit a design document that explains what data structures you will use to write simlines and how you will use them.

Your document should be a plain ASCII document called DESIGN and formatted to fit in 80 columns. If you prefer to use a word processor you can submit design.pdf.

To submit your design, change to the directory that contains the file and run the submit40-filesnpix-design command. For this to work, you will have had to run use comp40 either by hand or in your .cshrc or your .profile.
Before submitting your code

The purpose of these exercises is not just to teach you some tricky programming, it's to familiarize you with certain techniques, technologies, and approaches to programming.

Before submitting, each member of your team should go back and reread the purpose statement for this assignment.

Has each of you you truly achieved these goals? Pair programming is terrific, but you need to stop once in awhile to make sure that every member of your team is getting the experience needed to move ahead. Your next steps in COMP 40 depend on your being solid in these basics. It's a lot to learn in a week: if you're still unsure, talk to a TA or schedule time with the instructor.
Submitting your completed work

In your final submission, don't forget to include a README file which

    Identifies you and your programming partner by name and
    Acknowledges help you may have received from or collaborative work you may have undertaken with classmates, programming partners, course staff, or others
    Identifies what has been correctly implemented and what has not
    Says approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment 

Your final submission should include at least these files:

README
brightness.c
simlines.c

A carefully designed, modular solution for simlines will probably include at least two other files.

When you get everything working, cd into the directory you are submitting and type submit40-filesnpix to submit your work.
General advice for new C programmers

You will find some very helpful introductions to C on the COMP 40 course references page. Some of the primary differences between C and C++ include:

    C has structures but not classes: a C programmer must find good ways to manage together the definition of data structures and the code that manipulates those structures, but C will not make the connection for you.
    I/O in C is different from C++, and generally a somewhat lower level. Although C has a few simple facilities for reading in numbers etc., most of the input and output you do will be at the level of individual characters or bytes. Instead of doing input and output using the <iostream> C++ library with its convenient << operator and the cout and cin streams, you will use the <stdio.h> C library, with its less convenient printf, fgetc and fgets functions, etc. and the stdout and stdin file handles. (In C++, the operators << and >> are overloaded at multiple types, but C does not support operator overloading, so another approach is needed.)
    Don't forget to initialize each C pointer variable, and if necessary, the data to which it points. In C++, an object may be initialized implicitly by a constructor, so a construction like:

        Car *myCar_p = new Car;

    might allocate space for a Car object, initialize all the car member data, and set the myCar_p pointer.

    In C, you should use Hanson's NEW or malloc from the C library to allocate space for your data and to return a pointer:

        struct Car *myCar_p;

        /* Hanson */
        NEW(myCar_p);     /* allocate space for a Car struct and set myCar_p */

        /* C library: one of the following */
        myCar_p = malloc(sizeof(struct Car));  /* obvious but less foolproof */
        myCar_p = malloc(sizeof(*myCar_p));    /* better in most cases       */

    Crucially, none of the C constructions shown above actually initializes members of the Car structure; they just allocate the needed space. You will see in Hanson's book good techniques (e.g. functions like Table_new) for writing code that combines allocation with initialization to achieve roughly what C++ gives you.

    Of course, if you want to avoid memory leaks, you will eventually want to match each Hanson NEW with a FREE, and each malloc with a free. One excellent technique that professionals use is to write the cleanup code at the same time as the allocation code. So, typically, each time you code a malloc you code a matching free somewhere else. Very often the latter will be in the termination code that runs just before your program exits.

    One more detail to keep in mind: C++ and Hanson's library each have support for Exceptions, and those can result when C++ New or Hanson NEW fail to find the needed space. C itself does not have exceptions; if space can't be found then malloc returns NULL. You should always check after each malloc to ensure that it worked!
    You might wish to take three minutes to view, or review, Pointer Fun with Binky, and compare the code you see there with Hanson's NEW macro.
    Use the C programming idioms that we suggest for all good C programs!

Follow the Hanson model for checked runtime errors.  See section 2.4, p. 24ff for information about them, and observe their use in Hanson's code.

COMP 40 — Spring 2016
Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming

Home Calendar Reference Admin Piazza
Course Overview

COMP 40 will give you two important experiences:

    You will turn the corner from introductory programming to programming as a professional
    You will study in detail the structure of modern computers, and that in turn will add greatly to your understanding of how computer hardware, operating systems, compilers, language runtimes and other tools work together to influence the performance of your programs

These two goals are very closely related: all good computer professionals know how to apply deep knowledge of computing systems to their programming projects and to their research in computer science. Whether you are a newly confirmed CS major, someone who is considering a CS major but is unsure, or a student from another field who is interested in a deep look at some of the most important technologies of our time, COMP 40 should give you an intense, realistic and (we hope!) exciting look at how modern computers work.

For more information about the course see the about COMP 40 page, which includes a section on prerequisites.
Schedule

Lectures: Mondays/Wednesdays 3:00 – 4:15 PM in Anderson 206 and 208.
Labs: Friday 10:30 - 11:45 AM or 1:30 - 2:45 PM (Halligan 116 & 118 with overflow in 120)

Attendance at lectures and labs is mandatory. You are responsible for anything that is said in class or lab, including changes to homework assignments, in-class exercises, and useful information not documented elsewhere.

Note for spring 2016: Lectures are held in two separate rooms for the spring of 2016. If we are lucky, we will move into a larger room. I will be in Anderson 206 and we will use WebEx and the facilities in the two rooms to stream slides and drawings and audio into 208 and audio back from 208 to 206 (so students can ask questions).

Please be patient, and we'll try to work out how we can use the system most effectively.

We will randomly assign students to classrooms on a per-lecture basis so students who come further across campus don't get systematically locked out of 206.
Staff

The instructor for the course is Professor Mark Sheldon. Contact information, office hours, etc. are available from Mark's Home Page.

Our graduate teaching assistants are Carter Casey, Behnam Heydarshahi, Evana Gizzi, Sana Farrukh, and Jake Crawford. We also have numerous undergraduate teaching assistants who will hold office hours in the Halligan computing labs. Schedules for the undergraduate assistants will be posted and updated in Piazza.
Getting Help
COMP 40 covers a wide range of complex material. Even top students typically will need help regularly to learn the material and complete assignments. Details on various resources available to you are described on the course administration page.

For most technical questions please use Piazza! The professor and TAs monitor Piazza continually, and will attempt to answer your question promptly. Other students will benefit from seeing both your question and the answer and indeed in many cases, other students will answer your question before we do. For individual questions about grades, etc. the e-mail address comp40-staff@cs.tufts.edu will reach your instructor and all graduate teaching assistants. See the instructions for using Piazza on the course administration page.
Policies and procedures all students are required to know

All students are expected to understand and obey all of the rules and policies outlined on the course policies and administration page. These include especially the principles of academic integrity and the course policy on collaboration.

The same page also provides important information about course grading policies, homework, etc. Use the Piazza forum. You may also use other on-line sources, but when you do, you must observe the principles of academic integrity and the course policy on collaboration.
Feedback

Your candid comments on any aspect of the course are always welcome. For ideas you want to share with the rest of the COMP 40 community, please post in Piazza. Thanks to Chloe Lopez, you can also send an anonymous comment directly to your instructor. Click on the link which will get you a form on which you can submit your comment.

COMP 40 in its current form was originally created and taught by Prof. Norman Ramsey. Since then the course has been taught and adapted by Noah Daniels, Mark Sheldon, and Noah Mendelsohn. Much of the written course material and almost all of the programming assignments have been carried over or adapted from earlier work. Credit for the best of it goes to them; responsibility for any problems lies with the current instructor.

Pair programming: What to do when you're not holding the keyboard
In pair programming, usually only one person can type at a time. Here are some suggestions for the other person:

    If you have a spare USB keyboard, plug it in and keep it handy. That way you can switch with your partner without passing the keyboard (a procedure I have always found awkward).
    If you're not holding a keyboard, hold a pencil and a piece of paper.
    Keep your lips moving. If you understand what's going on, keep up a running commentary. If you don't understand what's going on, ask questions. 

So much for general advice. Here are some things you should do, especially if you're holding pencil and paper:

    If you're debugging and your partner is changing code, make a note of other parts of the program (in the same module or in other modules) that will have to be changed. For example, if your program does arithmetic, and you decide the math is wrong, if your partner is replacing ``old math'' with ``new math'', make a note of all the other places you'll have to inspect for ``old math.''
    If your partner is working the definition of a data structure, draw a picture of it.
    If your partner is writing down a struct definition, insist on a short same-line comment documenting each field.
    If your partner is working on an an algorithm, draw pictures of any relevant data structures.
    If your partner is writing new code, or revisiting old code that doesn't work, write down how to test it.

What is a script?

In computing, the term script refers to a program that invokes and coordinates the activities of other programs. An application build script is one that invokes compilers, linkers and other tools to compile and link your executable application. As we will see, some build tools are smart enough to understand which pieces of code depend on which others (e.g. which .c files include .h files) and to only recompile what's necessary when small changes are made.
Why use scripts to build your programs?

When you started programming in C++ or in C you probably learned to build your programs this way:

g++ -o myprog myprog.cpp

or

gcc -o myprog myprog.c

These commands use the Gnu compiler to compile a single source file into a runnable Linux executable. Directly calling the compiler this way is perfectly acceptable for simple programs but as you start building more complex programs a number of problems become obvious:

    Most large programs are built from multiple source files. Although it's often possible to name all of these on the command line, doing that is inconvenient.
    You will likely need to set a number of options on the g++ or gcc command line to override compiler defaults, to indicate which directories are to be searched for include files, etc., and you'll have to type those options correctly each time you recompile.
    If your program is big and has lots of source files, recompiling all the pieces each time you make a small change is wasteful.
    You may wish to build several different programs that share some common pieces; in such cases, it's very useful to have a tool that automatically rebuilds everything when shared pieces change.

Application build scripts automate the process of building an application or other program and they can also automate related tasks such as running tests. Build scripts make it much easier to rebuild your program, and that in turn should encourage you to recompile and test frequently as you create your program. Build scripts also help other programmers learn how to recompile and link your code.

In COMP 40, we rely on compile scripts with a known interface to build your homework submissions. That is, when you submit your program you will include a build script, and it must be invokable in just the way we specify. Typically we require a shell script named compile which, when run with no arguments, builds all the code and applications we've asked you to submit. Our test scripts depend on that compile script to build your code for testing. (Some assignments may ask for compile scripts in other forms, such as using a makefile, as described below).
What tools can you use to build your scripts?

In principle, any programming language or tool that can invoke other command line programs can be used to create application build scripts. These include general purpose scripting languages such as Python, PERL and Ruby; shell languages like sh, bash, csh and ksh; and tools like make, mk, ant, raven, maven, etc. that are designed specifically for creating application build scripts. Of these many choices, there are two (or maybe three) that you should know about for COMP 40:

    Shell languages (e.g. sh)

    When you are typing on the console of your Unix login session you are talking to a program known as a shell. This is a program that reads what you type, does some work like expanding filename wildcards, and then invokes the programs you've asked to run. In fact, the shell languages are themselves small prorgramming lanuages; although you usually type one command at a time, you can actually use them to write little loops, if statements, etc. right from the console. The same shell command processors can be used to run shell programs stored in files, but the situation is confused somewhat by the fact that over the years a number of competing shells have been built, each with its own language.

    Regardless of the shell you're running to interpret your console commands, the tradition in COMP 40 is to write compile scripts using the /bin/sh shell language. A section below provides hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh.
    make

    make is the most famous application build language. Although make is somewhat clumsy and ad-hoc in its syntax, it's very powerful and very widely used. If only for that reason, every good programmer should learn to use make.

    The key feature of make and of many other languages designed specifically for building applications is that it allows you to state which pieces of your program depend on which others. When you run make it checks the dates on all your files to determine what's been changed since the last time you built your application, and it rebuilds only files that depend, directly or indirectly, on changed files. You tell make how to do each step in the build process, e.g. how to build multiply.o from multiply.c, and make invokes only the steps that are needed.

    The rules for building each program or application are placed into a file known as a makefile. When you invoke make you can supply the name of the makefile to use:

                 make -f mymakefile myprog
        

    ...will use the makefile named mymakefile to build the program named myprog. If no makefile is named, make will try to find makefile or Makefile (in that order). The following will build myprog using one of those two makefiles.

                 make myprog
        

    When code is distributed for public use it's very common to find a makefile or Makefile along with the code. This is usually a signal that make is the tool to use for building that program.
    mk

    Even Stu Feldman, who many years ago created make, has acknowledged its problems. Among the tools he recommends as an alternative is mk (pronounced "muck"), which was created to support the experimental Plan 9 operating system at Bell Labs.

    The syntax of mk is arguably cleaner and easier to learn than that of make and mk has some powerful features that may be useful when you are building truly complex systems. Norman Ramsey gives a spirited defense of mk in How to Write Compile Scripts.

We may in some cases provide you with tools that are built with make or mk, and you are strongly advised to learn at least the basics of make. It's a skill that will serve you well in your career and one that potential employers may value. Some Hints for writing makefiles are also provided below.

mk is not nearly as widely used as the other tools discussed here but it's got a cleaner design than make and it also is the language we've used behind the scenes to build many of the COMP 40 course materials. You may occasionally see scripts with names like somescript.mk; that .mk suffix likely means that mk is the language being used.
Using build scripts for testing and packaging

Consider using make or other similar tools to integrate testing and packaging with the build process. For example, you might have a make target that does unit testing:

             make test-results

Write your makefile so that the target test-results depends on the executable program(s) being tested. Now if you change some source files and run the above command, make will automatically rebuild your application and immediately run tests on it. That can be a wonderful way to be sure that none of the changes you've made has broken anything that had been working. We strongly encourage you to build your test cases early in the development process and to retest your code after every significant change to the source.

In the same spirit, build targets can be used to invoke tools like valgrind:

             make valgrind-tests

You should have this target depend on an up-to-date build of your system, and then have it run one or more tests of your code using valgrind. Doing this will likely encourage you to run valgrind often, and to be sure that your code is up-to-date when you do.

If you're creating a system that will be distributed to others then a build target to create distribution packages can be very useful:

             make distribution

This would (if necessary) recompile and relink any code that's to be distributed to users in object form and then package the code, perhaps into a tar file, a zip file, or some other form that's convenient for distributing to others.

Of course, all these things can be done equally well with mk or with shell scripts.
Hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh

Here are some hints that may be useful for writing and understanding compile scripts in sh:
Finding documentation on sh

The first place to look for documentation on sh is in the man pages:

man sh

Sometimes doing this gives you the man page for an implementation called bash and indeed on our Tufts CS systems /bin/sh is just a link to /bin/bash; bash has some extensions, but for most of what you'll doing doing sh and bash are compatible. So, either man page is good enough for COMP 40 purposes. In any case, the man pages document the complete syntax of the language and give some instructions for using it. There are also lots of sh and bash tutorials on the Web.
Filename globbing

As we've seen, sh (like bash, csh, tcsh, ksh, etc.) is a language that's designed to interpret commands at an interactive command prompt. One of the services it provides is globbing, in which strings containing characters like * are replaced with a list of filenames matching the expression:

   ls mult*.c    # all files starting with "mult" and ending with .c
   cat [ab]*     # all files starting with "a" or "b"

This is done by replacing the expressions with lists of filenames that become the arguments to commands. So, the second line above might actually turn into the command:

   cat albert anthony.c bertha birtday.html bigdeal.cpp

...if those files happened to be in the current directory. Because sh runs your commands the same way when they come from a script file as from the console, the same globbing is done on every command in your scripts!
Arguments to the script

Your compile script is itself a program that will be invoked (most likely) from the command line. So, your script can be given arguments.

compile -link fgroups

has two arguments: -link and fgroups. You will often see within the compile script code that accesses these parameters. For example:

echo $2

would call the echo command, passing it the second parameter (fgroups for the command above). You can also find out how many parameters there are:

echo $#

echos the number "2", because the script was passed two parameters. You can also work with all the parameters together. If the number of arguments is nargs then:

echo $@    

...is the same as:

echo $1 $2 ... $nargs   

Surprisingly, it's also possible to update the argument list. For example:

shift
echo $@

This would echo only "fgroups", because the shift command shifts all the arguments to the left, and thus "loses" the "-unlink" argument. Such shifting is very commonly done to eliminate arguments such as switches after they have been processed by the script.

set *.c

Somewhat confusingly, the set command completely replaces the command line arguments! After the above command, the original arguments (-link fgroups) are gone, replaced with a list of all .c files. Specifically, globbing is done on *.c, so the set command is given a list of all .c files in the current directory. The set command then sets the argument list to that list of files.

One of the reasons scripts update the argument list is that some important internal script commands default to operating on the argument list:

for cfile 
do
  gcc -c $cfile
done

There are at least two important things to learn from the above example: the for loop iterates over the arguments in $@ (which, after the earlier set command is a list of all the user's .c files). Also, shell scripts have named variables that can be substituted into commands using the $variable_name syntax. So, the above command loops through all the files named in the argument list and calls gcc on each one.

It's also common to set variable names using the = operator. These lines of code are taken from a COMP 40 build script:

CC=gcc

CFLAGS="-I. -I/comp/40/include $CIIFLAGS"
FLAGS="-g -O -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -std=c99 -pedantic"

for cfile 
do
  $CC $FLAGS $CFLAGS -c $cfile
done

You should now be more or less able to understand what commands are executed by that code.
Back quotes

One thing missing from the above is the assignment to $CIIFLAGS. In the actual script, that turns out to use a feature you haven't seen:

CIIFLAGS=`pkg-config --cflags cii40`

Note carefully the backquotes ` surrounding the pkg-config command on the right. Also note that pkg-config has nothing to do with the shell language itself: it's an ordinary command just like gcc, cat or ls.

When a command in a script is in backquotes, the command is run and the output of the command is substituted in place of the quoted command text. So, in this example, the pkg-config command is run with the arguments --cflags cii40; the output of that pkg-config command is assigned to the shell variable CIIFLAGS. (To learn what pkg-config does, try man pkg-config, or else you can just guess that it probably figures out some switches we'll want to pass to the compiler when building something to do with "cii40"...which turns out to be the package name for the Hanson code we use in COMP 40!)
Conditionals

sh has if statements, for loops and many other features of traditional imperative programming languages. You'll need to check the man page for details, but you'll often be able to guess from the syntax what these constructs are doing. One feature for which sh uses a somewhat unusual syntax is conditionals like these::

if [ $linked = no ]; then
  # do something here if variable linked is equal to "no"
fi 

An expression in square brackets is called a conditional, and it evaluates to a boolean true or false. As you can see from the example above, string literals like no need not be quoted unless they contain spaces; variable references must begin with a dollar sign $.

Although the expression in brackets may look like part of the if statement syntax, it's not; the same conditional syntax can be used elsewhere, for example:

[ -n "$2" ] || { echo "You need a second argument to this script" >&2; exit 1; }

Note that the above is of the form: a || b. The expression a, which is the conditional [-n "$2"] is evaluated; if it's false, then expression b on the right is evaluated. That happens to be a compound statement of the form: {stmt1; stmt2;}.

The key to understanding the above example is that [ -n "$2"] is a conditional that tests the length of a string to ensure it's not empty. So, this example writes an error message to standard error only if there is no second argument to the script.

Many conditionals test the existence or nature of named files. for example:


[-e "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists
[-f "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists and is a file (not dir, etc)
[-d "/tmp/somedir"]     # True if /tmp/somedir is a directory

There are many, many other useful conditionals. See the man page for details.
A realistic example

You don't have to understand all of the above in detail on day 1 of COMP 40 but you should rapidly develop an intuition about which parts of each compile script are doing what. That way you will be able to make small modifications to the scripts and to debug them when they break.

Now, take a look at the compile script for a recent version of COMP 40 HW assignments 1; with luck, you'll be able to understand most of what it's doing (several of the fragments above are taken from that script).
The shebang #! convention

This is a good time to learn a Unix scripting techinque that's illustrated on the first line of the sample compile script, which says:

#!/bin/sh

It starts with a #, so the script processor considers it a comment, but it serves a very specific purpose. There are actually two ways you could run this script:

    sh compile -link fgroups: when you do it this way, that first line doesn't matter. You're telling the system to invoke the sh shell and your giving it the name of the script to execute. Whoever does this needs to know that it's an sh script.
    ./compile -link fgroups: done this way, we're treating the script itself as an executable command, but how does Unix know whether to run this using sh (or maybe Python or csh?). That's what that first "shebang" line is for: when you invoke a command that appears to be a text file, Unix (or Linux) looks at the first line. If it starts with:

    #!...some executable name here

    Then the named executable (in our case sh) is run and passed the file as a first argument!

So, we've been able to use our script as if it was a new command named compile (assuming that's the filename of the script). There is one more detail: for this to work you'll need to give your file execute permissions. A likely way to do that is:

chmod u+x compile

which uses the chmod Unix command to indicate that the user (that's the u) who owns the file is to have execute (x) permissions. Of course, you should see man chmod for more information on setting the permission mode.

Oh, and why is it called the "shebang" convention? The "#" character is the "sharp sign" or "hash" (or "number sign"), and the "!" character programmers call "bang". So, shebang. You'll often hear a programmer who's reading a string to another programmer pronounce it in this style: "hash bang slash bin slash usr", etc.

(By the way, if you're not bored yet, you'll surely want to know that the etyomology of the word shebang is surprisingly varied and ambiguous...and if that's not sufficiently obscure detail, the # sign is also known as the octothorpe!)
Hints for writing makefiles

There are many make tutorials and sample makefiles available on the Web. Of course, you should also do man make, and also consult the extensive reference manual for GNU Make (do try to avoid using GNU extensions unless needed). Here we give a short introduction to what make can do.
Tabs and spaces

One important warning about make: tabs and spaces aren't interchangeable!. When you see a rule like this in a makefile:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -o brightness brightness.c

there is a tab character (not spaces!) ahead of the command "gcc" on the second line. If your editor has a feature that replaces tabs with spaces, you'll have to turn that off when editing makefiles! (This is just an example of why people complain about make. Still, it's a very powerful tool that can do very useful things for you.)
Variables

Like shell scripts, makefiles allow you to set and substitute named variables:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: $(EXECUTABLES)

is more or less equivalent to:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: brightness fgroups

Targets and Dependencies

Consider again that same fragment:

all: brightness fgroups

This tells make that if the user says:

make all

...then it's necessary to ensure that fgroups and brightness are up to date. We say that the target all depends on fgroups and brightness. But how can the make system know whether those program(s) actually need to be rebuilt? Somewhere in the makefile should be another rule telling what those two programs depend on, and how to build them. A very simple rule might be:

brightness: brightness.o
    gcc -o brightness brightness.o 

which says to build brightness by linking brightness.o. Note that each rule starts with a target name in the left margin, followed by a colon, and optionally followed by any dependencies. If there are one or more commands needed to build the target, they are listed below, with tabs starting each such line.

Of course, we then need a rule for being sure that brightness.o is up to date, and telling us how to build that:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -c brightness.c

So, what happens if we issue the command "make brightness"? Make starts by building a tree of dependencies. What do we need to build brightness? Answer: an up-to-date brightness.o. What do we need to build that? There's another rule that tells us, and so on. After building the whole tree of dependencies the system will decide that the first check to be made is whether brightness.c been changed since brightness.o was last built. and if so that code will be recompiled. Then, if the brightness exectuable is older than the (possibly recompiled) brightness.o, the executable is relinked. In short, only necessary work is done.

Note that, unlike a script, a makefile is not a list of steps to be performed in order; it's a set of rules, and each rule is considered as needed according to the circumstance. Rules are chosen by pattern matching on filenames and by checking whether any dependencies must be rebuilt. Once a rule is chosen, there may indeed be one or more steps (actually zero or more) specified to build the target.
Pattern rules and automatic variables

Make has many many other sophisticated features, but there's one more you should learn early. Consider this fragment:

# 
#    To get any .o, compile the corresponding .c
#
%.o:%.c 
    gcc $(FLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

Our first approach required a separate rule for each .o, but all of those rules look almost the same. The fragment above uses what make calls pattern rules (e.g. %.c) and automatic variables (e.g. $<). You'll have to read the GNU make documentation for all the details, but what the fragment above says is:

    Every .o file depends on the corresponding .c file
    The name of that .c file is substituted into the gcc command after the -c option

So, a single rule suffices to build a .o file from any corresponding .c file. Also shown in the gcc command line is the substitution of two variables FLAGS and CFLAGS that we can assume have been set with the compiler options that we're using on this project. We can thus ensure that the same compiler options are automatically applied to each compilation. Obviously we can (and should) do something similar on the commands that link the executables.
A realistic example

Appendix II contains a makefile that builds HW assignments 1. With the hints given above you should be able to figure out most of what it's doing.

Right now, the COMP 40 homework submission process expects a compile script not a makefile; you should be sure to provide a working compile script or else your homework may not be graded. Still it's good to know how makefiles work, and we may sometime soon switch to using them for some assignments.
Build scripts as documentation

Like any other code you write, your build scripts and makefiles should be designed as documentation to be read by other programmers. Especially if you use languages like make or mk, your build scripts formally document which pieces of your system depend on which others. Of course, your scripts also document the compiler switches and other settings used.

Make sure your build scripts are cleanly structured and easy to read. When it's not obvious from the code, include comments explaining what various build targets do, and any other information that might be needed by someone maintaining or modifying your code. Be especially careful to document non-obvious dependencies on tools or libraries, e.g.:

# This build runs against the grapics library 
# version 2.8, which is current as of July, 2013.  The 
# program depends on features such as double buffering
# introduced in v2.8.  
# NEEDSWORK We should add an automatic configuration 
# test to ensure double buffering is available.

APPENDIX I: A COMP 40 Compile Script

This is the compile script for a recent version of COMP 40 HW 1. That assignment requires the development of two executables, named brightness and fgroups

APPENDIX II: A COMP 40 Makefile

The following makefile is more or less equivalent to the compile script shown above in Appendex I. Like that script, this makefile defaults to building the brightness and fgroups executables. So, if we assume this file is called Makefile, here are some commands we could issue:

make all          # builds fgroups and brightness and any needed .o files
make              # same as "make all" because all is the default target
make brightness   # builds brightness, and any .o files that needs
make fgroups.o    # recompiles fgroups.o only if fgroups.c is changed
make clean        # remove all .o files and executables fgroups and brightness

Here is the sample makefile:

#            Makefile for COMP 40 Homework 1
#
#     Author: Noah Mendelsohn (adapted from Norman Ramsey's compile script)
#
#  Maintenance targets:
#
#
#    all         - (default target) make sure everything's compiled
#    clean       - clean out all compiled object and executable files
#    brightness  - compile just the brightness program
#    fgroups     - compile just the fingerprint group program.
#
#

# Executables to built using "make all"

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

#
#  The following is a compromise. You MUST list all your .h files here.
#  If any .h file changes, all .c files will be recompiled. To do better,
#  we could make an explicit target for each .o, naming only the .h
#  files it really uses.
#
# Add your own .h files to the right side of the assingment below.

LIBS = $(CIILIBS) -lm    
LFLAGS = -L$(COMP40)/lib64

# these flags max out warnings and debug info
FLAGS = -g -O -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -std=c99 -pedantic

# 
#    'make all' will build all executables
#
#    Note that "all" is the default target that make will build
#    if nothing is specifically requested
#
all: $(EXECUTABLES)

# 
#    'make clean' will remove all object and executable files
#
clean:
    rm -f $(EXECUTABLES) *.o


# 
#    To get any .o, compile the corresponding .c
#

What is a script?

In computing, the term script refers to a program that invokes and coordinates the activities of other programs. An application build script is one that invokes compilers, linkers and other tools to compile and link your executable application. As we will see, some build tools are smart enough to understand which pieces of code depend on which others (e.g. which .c files include .h files) and to only recompile what's necessary when small changes are made.
Why use scripts to build your programs?

When you started programming in C++ or in C you probably learned to build your programs this way:

g++ -o myprog myprog.cpp

or

gcc -o myprog myprog.c

These commands use the Gnu compiler to compile a single source file into a runnable Linux executable. Directly calling the compiler this way is perfectly acceptable for simple programs but as you start building more complex programs a number of problems become obvious:

    Most large programs are built from multiple source files. Although it's often possible to name all of these on the command line, doing that is inconvenient.
    You will likely need to set a number of options on the g++ or gcc command line to override compiler defaults, to indicate which directories are to be searched for include files, etc., and you'll have to type those options correctly each time you recompile.
    If your program is big and has lots of source files, recompiling all the pieces each time you make a small change is wasteful.
    You may wish to build several different programs that share some common pieces; in such cases, it's very useful to have a tool that automatically rebuilds everything when shared pieces change.

Application build scripts automate the process of building an application or other program and they can also automate related tasks such as running tests. Build scripts make it much easier to rebuild your program, and that in turn should encourage you to recompile and test frequently as you create your program. Build scripts also help other programmers learn how to recompile and link your code.

In COMP 40, we rely on compile scripts with a known interface to build your homework submissions. That is, when you submit your program you will include a build script, and it must be invokable in just the way we specify. Typically we require a shell script named compile which, when run with no arguments, builds all the code and applications we've asked you to submit. Our test scripts depend on that compile script to build your code for testing. (Some assignments may ask for compile scripts in other forms, such as using a makefile, as described below).
What tools can you use to build your scripts?

In principle, any programming language or tool that can invoke other command line programs can be used to create application build scripts. These include general purpose scripting languages such as Python, PERL and Ruby; shell languages like sh, bash, csh and ksh; and tools like make, mk, ant, raven, maven, etc. that are designed specifically for creating application build scripts. Of these many choices, there are two (or maybe three) that you should know about for COMP 40:

    Shell languages (e.g. sh)

    When you are typing on the console of your Unix login session you are talking to a program known as a shell. This is a program that reads what you type, does some work like expanding filename wildcards, and then invokes the programs you've asked to run. In fact, the shell languages are themselves small prorgramming lanuages; although you usually type one command at a time, you can actually use them to write little loops, if statements, etc. right from the console. The same shell command processors can be used to run shell programs stored in files, but the situation is confused somewhat by the fact that over the years a number of competing shells have been built, each with its own language.

    Regardless of the shell you're running to interpret your console commands, the tradition in COMP 40 is to write compile scripts using the /bin/sh shell language. A section below provides hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh.
    make

    make is the most famous application build language. Although make is somewhat clumsy and ad-hoc in its syntax, it's very powerful and very widely used. If only for that reason, every good programmer should learn to use make.

    The key feature of make and of many other languages designed specifically for building applications is that it allows you to state which pieces of your program depend on which others. When you run make it checks the dates on all your files to determine what's been changed since the last time you built your application, and it rebuilds only files that depend, directly or indirectly, on changed files. You tell make how to do each step in the build process, e.g. how to build multiply.o from multiply.c, and make invokes only the steps that are needed.

    The rules for building each program or application are placed into a file known as a makefile. When you invoke make you can supply the name of the makefile to use:

                 make -f mymakefile myprog
        

    ...will use the makefile named mymakefile to build the program named myprog. If no makefile is named, make will try to find makefile or Makefile (in that order). The following will build myprog using one of those two makefiles.

                 make myprog
        

    When code is distributed for public use it's very common to find a makefile or Makefile along with the code. This is usually a signal that make is the tool to use for building that program.
    mk

    Even Stu Feldman, who many years ago created make, has acknowledged its problems. Among the tools he recommends as an alternative is mk (pronounced "muck"), which was created to support the experimental Plan 9 operating system at Bell Labs.

    The syntax of mk is arguably cleaner and easier to learn than that of make and mk has some powerful features that may be useful when you are building truly complex systems. Norman Ramsey gives a spirited defense of mk in How to Write Compile Scripts.

We may in some cases provide you with tools that are built with make or mk, and you are strongly advised to learn at least the basics of make. It's a skill that will serve you well in your career and one that potential employers may value. Some Hints for writing makefiles are also provided below.

mk is not nearly as widely used as the other tools discussed here but it's got a cleaner design than make and it also is the language we've used behind the scenes to build many of the COMP 40 course materials. You may occasionally see scripts with names like somescript.mk; that .mk suffix likely means that mk is the language being used.
Using build scripts for testing and packaging

Consider using make or other similar tools to integrate testing and packaging with the build process. For example, you might have a make target that does unit testing:

             make test-results

Write your makefile so that the target test-results depends on the executable program(s) being tested. Now if you change some source files and run the above command, make will automatically rebuild your application and immediately run tests on it. That can be a wonderful way to be sure that none of the changes you've made has broken anything that had been working. We strongly encourage you to build your test cases early in the development process and to retest your code after every significant change to the source.

In the same spirit, build targets can be used to invoke tools like valgrind:

             make valgrind-tests

You should have this target depend on an up-to-date build of your system, and then have it run one or more tests of your code using valgrind. Doing this will likely encourage you to run valgrind often, and to be sure that your code is up-to-date when you do.

If you're creating a system that will be distributed to others then a build target to create distribution packages can be very useful:

             make distribution

This would (if necessary) recompile and relink any code that's to be distributed to users in object form and then package the code, perhaps into a tar file, a zip file, or some other form that's convenient for distributing to others.

Of course, all these things can be done equally well with mk or with shell scripts.
Hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh

Here are some hints that may be useful for writing and understanding compile scripts in sh:
Finding documentation on sh

The first place to look for documentation on sh is in the man pages:

man sh

Sometimes doing this gives you the man page for an implementation called bash and indeed on our Tufts CS systems /bin/sh is just a link to /bin/bash; bash has some extensions, but for most of what you'll doing doing sh and bash are compatible. So, either man page is good enough for COMP 40 purposes. In any case, the man pages document the complete syntax of the language and give some instructions for using it. There are also lots of sh and bash tutorials on the Web.
Filename globbing

As we've seen, sh (like bash, csh, tcsh, ksh, etc.) is a language that's designed to interpret commands at an interactive command prompt. One of the services it provides is globbing, in which strings containing characters like * are replaced with a list of filenames matching the expression:

   ls mult*.c    # all files starting with "mult" and ending with .c
   cat [ab]*     # all files starting with "a" or "b"

This is done by replacing the expressions with lists of filenames that become the arguments to commands. So, the second line above might actually turn into the command:

   cat albert anthony.c bertha birtday.html bigdeal.cpp

...if those files happened to be in the current directory. Because sh runs your commands the same way when they come from a script file as from the console, the same globbing is done on every command in your scripts!
Arguments to the script

Your compile script is itself a program that will be invoked (most likely) from the command line. So, your script can be given arguments.

compile -link fgroups

has two arguments: -link and fgroups. You will often see within the compile script code that accesses these parameters. For example:

echo $2

would call the echo command, passing it the second parameter (fgroups for the command above). You can also find out how many parameters there are:

echo $#

echos the number "2", because the script was passed two parameters. You can also work with all the parameters together. If the number of arguments is nargs then:

echo $@    

...is the same as:

echo $1 $2 ... $nargs   

Surprisingly, it's also possible to update the argument list. For example:

shift
echo $@

This would echo only "fgroups", because the shift command shifts all the arguments to the left, and thus "loses" the "-unlink" argument. Such shifting is very commonly done to eliminate arguments such as switches after they have been processed by the script.

set *.c

Somewhat confusingly, the set command completely replaces the command line arguments! After the above command, the original arguments (-link fgroups) are gone, replaced with a list of all .c files. Specifically, globbing is done on *.c, so the set command is given a list of all .c files in the current directory. The set command then sets the argument list to that list of files.

One of the reasons scripts update the argument list is that some important internal script commands default to operating on the argument list:

for cfile 
do
  gcc -c $cfile
done

There are at least two important things to learn from the above example: the for loop iterates over the arguments in $@ (which, after the earlier set command is a list of all the user's .c files). Also, shell scripts have named variables that can be substituted into commands using the $variable_name syntax. So, the above command loops through all the files named in the argument list and calls gcc on each one.

It's also common to set variable names using the = operator. These lines of code are taken from a COMP 40 build script:

CC=gcc

CFLAGS="-I. -I/comp/40/include $CIIFLAGS"
FLAGS="-g -O -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -std=c99 -pedantic"

for cfile 
do
  $CC $FLAGS $CFLAGS -c $cfile
done

You should now be more or less able to understand what commands are executed by that code.
Back quotes

One thing missing from the above is the assignment to $CIIFLAGS. In the actual script, that turns out to use a feature you haven't seen:

CIIFLAGS=`pkg-config --cflags cii40`

Note carefully the backquotes ` surrounding the pkg-config command on the right. Also note that pkg-config has nothing to do with the shell language itself: it's an ordinary command just like gcc, cat or ls.

When a command in a script is in backquotes, the command is run and the output of the command is substituted in place of the quoted command text. So, in this example, the pkg-config command is run with the arguments --cflags cii40; the output of that pkg-config command is assigned to the shell variable CIIFLAGS. (To learn what pkg-config does, try man pkg-config, or else you can just guess that it probably figures out some switches we'll want to pass to the compiler when building something to do with "cii40"...which turns out to be the package name for the Hanson code we use in COMP 40!)
Conditionals

sh has if statements, for loops and many other features of traditional imperative programming languages. You'll need to check the man page for details, but you'll often be able to guess from the syntax what these constructs are doing. One feature for which sh uses a somewhat unusual syntax is conditionals like these::

if [ $linked = no ]; then
  # do something here if variable linked is equal to "no"
fi 

An expression in square brackets is called a conditional, and it evaluates to a boolean true or false. As you can see from the example above, string literals like no need not be quoted unless they contain spaces; variable references must begin with a dollar sign $.

Although the expression in brackets may look like part of the if statement syntax, it's not; the same conditional syntax can be used elsewhere, for example:

[ -n "$2" ] || { echo "You need a second argument to this script" >&2; exit 1; }

Note that the above is of the form: a || b. The expression a, which is the conditional [-n "$2"] is evaluated; if it's false, then expression b on the right is evaluated. That happens to be a compound statement of the form: {stmt1; stmt2;}.

The key to understanding the above example is that [ -n "$2"] is a conditional that tests the length of a string to ensure it's not empty. So, this example writes an error message to standard error only if there is no second argument to the script.

Many conditionals test the existence or nature of named files. for example:


[-e "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists
[-f "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists and is a file (not dir, etc)
[-d "/tmp/somedir"]     # True if /tmp/somedir is a directory

There are many, many other useful conditionals. See the man page for details.
A realistic example

You don't have to understand all of the above in detail on day 1 of COMP 40 but you should rapidly develop an intuition about which parts of each compile script are doing what. That way you will be able to make small modifications to the scripts and to debug them when they break.

Now, take a look at the compile script for a recent version of COMP 40 HW assignments 1; with luck, you'll be able to understand most of what it's doing (several of the fragments above are taken from that script).
The shebang #! convention

This is a good time to learn a Unix scripting techinque that's illustrated on the first line of the sample compile script, which says:

#!/bin/sh

It starts with a #, so the script processor considers it a comment, but it serves a very specific purpose. There are actually two ways you could run this script:

    sh compile -link fgroups: when you do it this way, that first line doesn't matter. You're telling the system to invoke the sh shell and your giving it the name of the script to execute. Whoever does this needs to know that it's an sh script.
    ./compile -link fgroups: done this way, we're treating the script itself as an executable command, but how does Unix know whether to run this using sh (or maybe Python or csh?). That's what that first "shebang" line is for: when you invoke a command that appears to be a text file, Unix (or Linux) looks at the first line. If it starts with:

    #!...some executable name here

    Then the named executable (in our case sh) is run and passed the file as a first argument!

So, we've been able to use our script as if it was a new command named compile (assuming that's the filename of the script). There is one more detail: for this to work you'll need to give your file execute permissions. A likely way to do that is:

chmod u+x compile

which uses the chmod Unix command to indicate that the user (that's the u) who owns the file is to have execute (x) permissions. Of course, you should see man chmod for more information on setting the permission mode.

Oh, and why is it called the "shebang" convention? The "#" character is the "sharp sign" or "hash" (or "number sign"), and the "!" character programmers call "bang". So, shebang. You'll often hear a programmer who's reading a string to another programmer pronounce it in this style: "hash bang slash bin slash usr", etc.

(By the way, if you're not bored yet, you'll surely want to know that the etyomology of the word shebang is surprisingly varied and ambiguous...and if that's not sufficiently obscure detail, the # sign is also known as the octothorpe!)
Hints for writing makefiles

There are many make tutorials and sample makefiles available on the Web. Of course, you should also do man make, and also consult the extensive reference manual for GNU Make (do try to avoid using GNU extensions unless needed). Here we give a short introduction to what make can do.
Tabs and spaces

One important warning about make: tabs and spaces aren't interchangeable!. When you see a rule like this in a makefile:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -o brightness brightness.c

there is a tab character (not spaces!) ahead of the command "gcc" on the second line. If your editor has a feature that replaces tabs with spaces, you'll have to turn that off when editing makefiles! (This is just an example of why people complain about make. Still, it's a very powerful tool that can do very useful things for you.)
Variables

Like shell scripts, makefiles allow you to set and substitute named variables:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: $(EXECUTABLES)

is more or less equivalent to:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: brightness fgroups

Targets and Dependencies

Consider again that same fragment:

all: brightness fgroups

This tells make that if the user says:

make all

...then it's necessary to ensure that fgroups and brightness are up to date. We say that the target all depends on fgroups and brightness. But how can the make system know whether those program(s) actually need to be rebuilt? Somewhere in the makefile should be another rule telling what those two programs depend on, and how to build them. A very simple rule might be:

brightness: brightness.o
    gcc -o brightness brightness.o 

which says to build brightness by linking brightness.o. Note that each rule starts with a target name in the left margin, followed by a colon, and optionally followed by any dependencies. If there are one or more commands needed to build the target, they are listed below, with tabs starting each such line.

Of course, we then need a rule for being sure that brightness.o is up to date, and telling us how to build that:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -c brightness.c

So, what happens if we issue the command "make brightness"? Make starts by building a tree of dependencies. What do we need to build brightness? Answer: an up-to-date brightness.o. What do we need to build that? There's another rule that tells us, and so on. After building the whole tree of dependencies the system will decide that the first check to be made is whether brightness.c been changed since brightness.o was last built. and if so that code will be recompiled. Then, if the brightness exectuable is older than the (possibly recompiled) brightness.o, the executable is relinked. In short, only necessary work is done.

Note that, unlike a script, a makefile is not a list of steps to be performed in order; it's a set of rules, and each rule is considered as needed according to the circumstance. Rules are chosen by pattern matching on filenames and by checking whether any dependencies must be rebuilt. Once a rule is chosen, there may indeed be one or more steps (actually zero or more) specified to build the target.
Pattern rules and automatic variables

Make has many many other sophisticated features, but there's one more you should learn early. Consider this fragment:

# 
#    To get any .o, compile the corresponding .c
#
%.o:%.c 
    gcc $(FLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

Our first approach required a separate rule for each .o, but all of those rules look almost the same. The fragment above uses what make calls pattern rules (e.g. %.c) and automatic variables (e.g. $<). You'll have to read the GNU make documentation for all the details, but what the fragment above says is:

    Every .o file depends on the corresponding .c file
    The name of that .c file is substituted into the gcc command after the -c option

So, a single rule suffices to build a .o file from any corresponding .c file. Also shown in the gcc command line is the substitution of two variables FLAGS and CFLAGS that we can assume have been set with the compiler options that we're using on this project. We can thus ensure that the same compiler options are automatically applied to each compilation. Obviously we can (and should) do something similar on the commands that link the executables.
A realistic example

Appendix II contains a makefile that builds HW assignments 1. With the hints given above you should be able to figure out most of what it's doing.

Right now, the COMP 40 homework submission process expects a compile script not a makefile; you should be sure to provide a working compile script or else your homework may not be graded. Still it's good to know how makefiles work, and we may sometime soon switch to using them for some assignments.
Build scripts as documentation

Like any other code you write, your build scripts and makefiles should be designed as documentation to be read by other programmers. Especially if you use languages like make or mk, your build scripts formally document which pieces of your system depend on which others. Of course, your scripts also document the compiler switches and other settings used.

Make sure your build scripts are cleanly structured and easy to read. When it's not obvious from the code, include comments explaining what various build targets do, and any other information that might be needed by someone maintaining or modifying your code. Be especially careful to document non-obvious dependencies on tools or libraries, e.g.:

# This build runs against the grapics library 
# version 2.8, which is current as of July, 2013.  The 
# program depends on features such as double buffering
# introduced in v2.8.  
# NEEDSWORK We should add an automatic configuration 
# test to ensure double buffering is available.

APPENDIX I: A COMP 40 Compile Script

This is the compile script for a recent version of COMP 40 HW 1. That assignment requires the development of two executables, named brightness and fgroups

APPENDIX II: A COMP 40 Makefile

The following makefile is more or less equivalent to the compile script shown above in Appendex I. Like that script, this makefile defaults to building the brightness and fgroups executables. So, if we assume this file is called Makefile, here are some commands we could issue:

make all          # builds fgroups and brightness and any needed .o files
make              # same as "make all" because all is the default target
make brightness   # builds brightness, and any .o files that needs
make fgroups.o    # recompiles fgroups.o only if fgroups.c is changed
make clean        # remove all .o files and executables fgroups and brightness

Here is the sample makefile:

#            Makefile for COMP 40 Homework 1
#
#     Author: Noah Mendelsohn (adapted from Norman Ramsey's compile script)
#
#  Maintenance targets:
#
#
#    all         - (default target) make sure everything's compiled
#    clean       - clean out all compiled object and executable files
#    brightness  - compile just the brightness program
#    fgroups     - compile just the fingerprint group program.
#
#

# Executables to built using "make all"

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

#
#  The following is a compromise. You MUST list all your .h files here.
#  If any .h file changes, all .c files will be recompiled. To do better,
#  we could make an explicit target for each .o, naming only the .h
#  files it really uses.
#
# Add your own .h files to the right side of the assingment below.

# these flags max out warnings and debug info
FLAGS = -g -O -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -std=c99 -pedantic

# 
#    'make all' will build all executables
#
#    Note that "all" is the default target that make will build
#    if nothing is specifically requested
#
all: $(EXECUTABLES)

# 
#    'make clean' will remove all object and executable files
#
clean:
    rm -f $(EXECUTABLES) *.o


# 
#    To get any .o, compile the corresponding .c
#

What is a script?

In computing, the term script refers to a program that invokes and coordinates the activities of other programs. An application build script is one that invokes compilers, linkers and other tools to compile and link your executable application. As we will see, some build tools are smart enough to understand which pieces of code depend on which others (e.g. which .c files include .h files) and to only recompile what's necessary when small changes are made.
Why use scripts to build your programs?

When you started programming in C++ or in C you probably learned to build your programs this way:

g++ -o myprog myprog.cpp

or

gcc -o myprog myprog.c

These commands use the Gnu compiler to compile a single source file into a runnable Linux executable. Directly calling the compiler this way is perfectly acceptable for simple programs but as you start building more complex programs a number of problems become obvious:

    Most large programs are built from multiple source files. Although it's often possible to name all of these on the command line, doing that is inconvenient.
    You will likely need to set a number of options on the g++ or gcc command line to override compiler defaults, to indicate which directories are to be searched for include files, etc., and you'll have to type those options correctly each time you recompile.
    If your program is big and has lots of source files, recompiling all the pieces each time you make a small change is wasteful.
    You may wish to build several different programs that share some common pieces; in such cases, it's very useful to have a tool that automatically rebuilds everything when shared pieces change.

Application build scripts automate the process of building an application or other program and they can also automate related tasks such as running tests. Build scripts make it much easier to rebuild your program, and that in turn should encourage you to recompile and test frequently as you create your program. Build scripts also help other programmers learn how to recompile and link your code.

In COMP 40, we rely on compile scripts with a known interface to build your homework submissions. That is, when you submit your program you will include a build script, and it must be invokable in just the way we specify. Typically we require a shell script named compile which, when run with no arguments, builds all the code and applications we've asked you to submit. Our test scripts depend on that compile script to build your code for testing. (Some assignments may ask for compile scripts in other forms, such as using a makefile, as described below).
What tools can you use to build your scripts?

In principle, any programming language or tool that can invoke other command line programs can be used to create application build scripts. These include general purpose scripting languages such as Python, PERL and Ruby; shell languages like sh, bash, csh and ksh; and tools like make, mk, ant, raven, maven, etc. that are designed specifically for creating application build scripts. Of these many choices, there are two (or maybe three) that you should know about for COMP 40:

    Shell languages (e.g. sh)

    When you are typing on the console of your Unix login session you are talking to a program known as a shell. This is a program that reads what you type, does some work like expanding filename wildcards, and then invokes the programs you've asked to run. In fact, the shell languages are themselves small prorgramming lanuages; although you usually type one command at a time, you can actually use them to write little loops, if statements, etc. right from the console. The same shell command processors can be used to run shell programs stored in files, but the situation is confused somewhat by the fact that over the years a number of competing shells have been built, each with its own language.

    Regardless of the shell you're running to interpret your console commands, the tradition in COMP 40 is to write compile scripts using the /bin/sh shell language. A section below provides hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh.
    make

    make is the most famous application build language. Although make is somewhat clumsy and ad-hoc in its syntax, it's very powerful and very widely used. If only for that reason, every good programmer should learn to use make.

    The key feature of make and of many other languages designed specifically for building applications is that it allows you to state which pieces of your program depend on which others. When you run make it checks the dates on all your files to determine what's been changed since the last time you built your application, and it rebuilds only files that depend, directly or indirectly, on changed files. You tell make how to do each step in the build process, e.g. how to build multiply.o from multiply.c, and make invokes only the steps that are needed.

    The rules for building each program or application are placed into a file known as a makefile. When you invoke make you can supply the name of the makefile to use:

                 make -f mymakefile myprog
        

    ...will use the makefile named mymakefile to build the program named myprog. If no makefile is named, make will try to find makefile or Makefile (in that order). The following will build myprog using one of those two makefiles.

                 make myprog
        

    When code is distributed for public use it's very common to find a makefile or Makefile along with the code. This is usually a signal that make is the tool to use for building that program.
    mk

    Even Stu Feldman, who many years ago created make, has acknowledged its problems. Among the tools he recommends as an alternative is mk (pronounced "muck"), which was created to support the experimental Plan 9 operating system at Bell Labs.

    The syntax of mk is arguably cleaner and easier to learn than that of make and mk has some powerful features that may be useful when you are building truly complex systems. Norman Ramsey gives a spirited defense of mk in How to Write Compile Scripts.

We may in some cases provide you with tools that are built with make or mk, and you are strongly advised to learn at least the basics of make. It's a skill that will serve you well in your career and one that potential employers may value. Some Hints for writing makefiles are also provided below.

mk is not nearly as widely used as the other tools discussed here but it's got a cleaner design than make and it also is the language we've used behind the scenes to build many of the COMP 40 course materials. You may occasionally see scripts with names like somescript.mk; that .mk suffix likely means that mk is the language being used.
Using build scripts for testing and packaging

Consider using make or other similar tools to integrate testing and packaging with the build process. For example, you might have a make target that does unit testing:

             make test-results

Write your makefile so that the target test-results depends on the executable program(s) being tested. Now if you change some source files and run the above command, make will automatically rebuild your application and immediately run tests on it. That can be a wonderful way to be sure that none of the changes you've made has broken anything that had been working. We strongly encourage you to build your test cases early in the development process and to retest your code after every significant change to the source.

In the same spirit, build targets can be used to invoke tools like valgrind:

             make valgrind-tests

You should have this target depend on an up-to-date build of your system, and then have it run one or more tests of your code using valgrind. Doing this will likely encourage you to run valgrind often, and to be sure that your code is up-to-date when you do.

If you're creating a system that will be distributed to others then a build target to create distribution packages can be very useful:

             make distribution

This would (if necessary) recompile and relink any code that's to be distributed to users in object form and then package the code, perhaps into a tar file, a zip file, or some other form that's convenient for distributing to others.

Of course, all these things can be done equally well with mk or with shell scripts.
Hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh

Here are some hints that may be useful for writing and understanding compile scripts in sh:
Finding documentation on sh

The first place to look for documentation on sh is in the man pages:

man sh

Sometimes doing this gives you the man page for an implementation called bash and indeed on our Tufts CS systems /bin/sh is just a link to /bin/bash; bash has some extensions, but for most of what you'll doing doing sh and bash are compatible. So, either man page is good enough for COMP 40 purposes. In any case, the man pages document the complete syntax of the language and give some instructions for using it. There are also lots of sh and bash tutorials on the Web.
Filename globbing

As we've seen, sh (like bash, csh, tcsh, ksh, etc.) is a language that's designed to interpret commands at an interactive command prompt. One of the services it provides is globbing, in which strings containing characters like * are replaced with a list of filenames matching the expression:

   ls mult*.c    # all files starting with "mult" and ending with .c
   cat [ab]*     # all files starting with "a" or "b"

This is done by replacing the expressions with lists of filenames that become the arguments to commands. So, the second line above might actually turn into the command:

   cat albert anthony.c bertha birtday.html bigdeal.cpp

...if those files happened to be in the current directory. Because sh runs your commands the same way when they come from a script file as from the console, the same globbing is done on every command in your scripts!
Arguments to the script

Your compile script is itself a program that will be invoked (most likely) from the command line. So, your script can be given arguments.

compile -link fgroups

has two arguments: -link and fgroups. You will often see within the compile script code that accesses these parameters. For example:

echo $2

would call the echo command, passing it the second parameter (fgroups for the command above). You can also find out how many parameters there are:

echo $#

echos the number "2", because the script was passed two parameters. You can also work with all the parameters together. If the number of arguments is nargs then:

echo $@    

...is the same as:

echo $1 $2 ... $nargs   

Surprisingly, it's also possible to update the argument list. For example:

shift
echo $@

This would echo only "fgroups", because the shift command shifts all the arguments to the left, and thus "loses" the "-unlink" argument. Such shifting is very commonly done to eliminate arguments such as switches after they have been processed by the script.

set *.c

Somewhat confusingly, the set command completely replaces the command line arguments! After the above command, the original arguments (-link fgroups) are gone, replaced with a list of all .c files. Specifically, globbing is done on *.c, so the set command is given a list of all .c files in the current directory. The set command then sets the argument list to that list of files.

One of the reasons scripts update the argument list is that some important internal script commands default to operating on the argument list:

for cfile 
do
  gcc -c $cfile
done

There are at least two important things to learn from the above example: the for loop iterates over the arguments in $@ (which, after the earlier set command is a list of all the user's .c files). Also, shell scripts have named variables that can be substituted into commands using the $variable_name syntax. So, the above command loops through all the files named in the argument list and calls gcc on each one.

It's also common to set variable names using the = operator. These lines of code are taken from a COMP 40 build script:

CC=gcc

CFLAGS="-I. -I/comp/40/include $CIIFLAGS"
FLAGS="-g -O -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -std=c99 -pedantic"

for cfile 
do
  $CC $FLAGS $CFLAGS -c $cfile
done

You should now be more or less able to understand what commands are executed by that code.
Back quotes

One thing missing from the above is the assignment to $CIIFLAGS. In the actual script, that turns out to use a feature you haven't seen:

CIIFLAGS=`pkg-config --cflags cii40`

Note carefully the backquotes ` surrounding the pkg-config command on the right. Also note that pkg-config has nothing to do with the shell language itself: it's an ordinary command just like gcc, cat or ls.

When a command in a script is in backquotes, the command is run and the output of the command is substituted in place of the quoted command text. So, in this example, the pkg-config command is run with the arguments --cflags cii40; the output of that pkg-config command is assigned to the shell variable CIIFLAGS. (To learn what pkg-config does, try man pkg-config, or else you can just guess that it probably figures out some switches we'll want to pass to the compiler when building something to do with "cii40"...which turns out to be the package name for the Hanson code we use in COMP 40!)
Conditionals

sh has if statements, for loops and many other features of traditional imperative programming languages. You'll need to check the man page for details, but you'll often be able to guess from the syntax what these constructs are doing. One feature for which sh uses a somewhat unusual syntax is conditionals like these::

if [ $linked = no ]; then
  # do something here if variable linked is equal to "no"
fi 

An expression in square brackets is called a conditional, and it evaluates to a boolean true or false. As you can see from the example above, string literals like no need not be quoted unless they contain spaces; variable references must begin with a dollar sign $.

Although the expression in brackets may look like part of the if statement syntax, it's not; the same conditional syntax can be used elsewhere, for example:

[ -n "$2" ] || { echo "You need a second argument to this script" >&2; exit 1; }

Note that the above is of the form: a || b. The expression a, which is the conditional [-n "$2"] is evaluated; if it's false, then expression b on the right is evaluated. That happens to be a compound statement of the form: {stmt1; stmt2;}.

The key to understanding the above example is that [ -n "$2"] is a conditional that tests the length of a string to ensure it's not empty. So, this example writes an error message to standard error only if there is no second argument to the script.

Many conditionals test the existence or nature of named files. for example:


[-e "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists
[-f "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists and is a file (not dir, etc)
[-d "/tmp/somedir"]     # True if /tmp/somedir is a directory

There are many, many other useful conditionals. See the man page for details.
A realistic example

You don't have to understand all of the above in detail on day 1 of COMP 40 but you should rapidly develop an intuition about which parts of each compile script are doing what. That way you will be able to make small modifications to the scripts and to debug them when they break.

Now, take a look at the compile script for a recent version of COMP 40 HW assignments 1; with luck, you'll be able to understand most of what it's doing (several of the fragments above are taken from that script).
The shebang #! convention

This is a good time to learn a Unix scripting techinque that's illustrated on the first line of the sample compile script, which says:

#!/bin/sh

It starts with a #, so the script processor considers it a comment, but it serves a very specific purpose. There are actually two ways you could run this script:

    sh compile -link fgroups: when you do it this way, that first line doesn't matter. You're telling the system to invoke the sh shell and your giving it the name of the script to execute. Whoever does this needs to know that it's an sh script.
    ./compile -link fgroups: done this way, we're treating the script itself as an executable command, but how does Unix know whether to run this using sh (or maybe Python or csh?). That's what that first "shebang" line is for: when you invoke a command that appears to be a text file, Unix (or Linux) looks at the first line. If it starts with:

    #!...some executable name here

    Then the named executable (in our case sh) is run and passed the file as a first argument!

So, we've been able to use our script as if it was a new command named compile (assuming that's the filename of the script). There is one more detail: for this to work you'll need to give your file execute permissions. A likely way to do that is:

chmod u+x compile

which uses the chmod Unix command to indicate that the user (that's the u) who owns the file is to have execute (x) permissions. Of course, you should see man chmod for more information on setting the permission mode.

Oh, and why is it called the "shebang" convention? The "#" character is the "sharp sign" or "hash" (or "number sign"), and the "!" character programmers call "bang". So, shebang. You'll often hear a programmer who's reading a string to another programmer pronounce it in this style: "hash bang slash bin slash usr", etc.

(By the way, if you're not bored yet, you'll surely want to know that the etyomology of the word shebang is surprisingly varied and ambiguous...and if that's not sufficiently obscure detail, the # sign is also known as the octothorpe!)
Hints for writing makefiles

There are many make tutorials and sample makefiles available on the Web. Of course, you should also do man make, and also consult the extensive reference manual for GNU Make (do try to avoid using GNU extensions unless needed). Here we give a short introduction to what make can do.
Tabs and spaces

One important warning about make: tabs and spaces aren't interchangeable!. When you see a rule like this in a makefile:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -o brightness brightness.c

there is a tab character (not spaces!) ahead of the command "gcc" on the second line. If your editor has a feature that replaces tabs with spaces, you'll have to turn that off when editing makefiles! (This is just an example of why people complain about make. Still, it's a very powerful tool that can do very useful things for you.)
Variables

Like shell scripts, makefiles allow you to set and substitute named variables:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: $(EXECUTABLES)

is more or less equivalent to:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: brightness fgroups

Targets and Dependencies

Consider again that same fragment:

all: brightness fgroups

This tells make that if the user says:

make all

...then it's necessary to ensure that fgroups and brightness are up to date. We say that the target all depends on fgroups and brightness. But how can the make system know whether those program(s) actually need to be rebuilt? Somewhere in the makefile should be another rule telling what those two programs depend on, and how to build them. A very simple rule might be:

brightness: brightness.o
    gcc -o brightness brightness.o 

which says to build brightness by linking brightness.o. Note that each rule starts with a target name in the left margin, followed by a colon, and optionally followed by any dependencies. If there are one or more commands needed to build the target, they are listed below, with tabs starting each such line.

Of course, we then need a rule for being sure that brightness.o is up to date, and telling us how to build that:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -c brightness.c

So, what happens if we issue the command "make brightness"? Make starts by building a tree of dependencies. What do we need to build brightness? Answer: an up-to-date brightness.o. What do we need to build that? There's another rule that tells us, and so on. After building the whole tree of dependencies the system will decide that the first check to be made is whether brightness.c been changed since brightness.o was last built. and if so that code will be recompiled. Then, if the brightness exectuable is older than the (possibly recompiled) brightness.o, the executable is relinked. In short, only necessary work is done.

Note that, unlike a script, a makefile is not a list of steps to be performed in order; it's a set of rules, and each rule is considered as needed according to the circumstance. Rules are chosen by pattern matching on filenames and by checking whether any dependencies must be rebuilt. Once a rule is chosen, there may indeed be one or more steps (actually zero or more) specified to build the target.
Pattern rules and automatic variables

Make has many many other sophisticated features, but there's one more you should learn early. Consider this fragment:

# 
#    To get any .o, compile the corresponding .c
#
%.o:%.c 
    gcc $(FLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

Our first approach required a separate rule for each .o, but all of those rules look almost the same. The fragment above uses what make calls pattern rules (e.g. %.c) and automatic variables (e.g. $<). You'll have to read the GNU make documentation for all the details, but what the fragment above says is:

    Every .o file depends on the corresponding .c file
    The name of that .c file is substituted into the gcc command after the -c option

So, a single rule suffices to build a .o file from any corresponding .c file. Also shown in the gcc command line is the substitution of two variables FLAGS and CFLAGS that we can assume have been set with the compiler options that we're using on this project. We can thus ensure that the same compiler options are automatically applied to each compilation. Obviously we can (and should) do something similar on the commands that link the executables.
A realistic example

Appendix II contains a makefile that builds HW assignments 1. With the hints given above you should be able to figure out most of what it's doing.

Right now, the COMP 40 homework submission process expects a compile script not a makefile; you should be sure to provide a working compile script or else your homework may not be graded. Still it's good to know how makefiles work, and we may sometime soon switch to using them for some assignments.
Build scripts as documentation

Like any other code you write, your build scripts and makefiles should be designed as documentation to be read by other programmers. Especially if you use languages like make or mk, your build scripts formally document which pieces of your system depend on which others. Of course, your scripts also document the compiler switches and other settings used.

Make sure your build scripts are cleanly structured and easy to read. When it's not obvious from the code, include comments explaining what various build targets do, and any other information that might be needed by someone maintaining or modifying your code. Be especially careful to document non-obvious dependencies on tools or libraries, e.g.:

# This build runs against the grapics library 
# version 2.8, which is current as of July, 2013.  The 
# program depends on features such as double buffering
# introduced in v2.8.  
# NEEDSWORK We should add an automatic configuration 
# test to ensure double buffering is available.

APPENDIX I: A COMP 40 Compile Script

APPENDIX II: A COMP 40 Makefile

The following makefile is more or less equivalent to the compile script shown above in Appendex I. Like that script, this makefile defaults to building the brightness and fgroups executables. So, if we assume this file is called Makefile, here are some commands we could issue:

make all          # builds fgroups and brightness and any needed .o files
make              # same as "make all" because all is the default target
make brightness   # builds brightness, and any .o files that needs
make fgroups.o    # recompiles fgroups.o only if fgroups.c is changed
make clean        # remove all .o files and executables fgroups and brightness

Here is the sample makefile:

#            Makefile for COMP 40 Homework 1
#
#     Author: Noah Mendelsohn (adapted from Norman Ramsey's compile script)
#
#  Maintenance targets:
#
#
#    all         - (default target) make sure everything's compiled
#    clean       - clean out all compiled object and executable files
#    brightness  - compile just the brightness program
#    fgroups     - compile just the fingerprint group program.
#
#

# Executables to built using "make all"

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

#
#  The following is a compromise. You MUST list all your .h files here.
#  If any .h file changes, all .c files will be recompiled. To do better,
#  we could make an explicit target for each .o, naming only the .h
#  files it really uses.
#

What is a script?

In computing, the term script refers to a program that invokes and coordinates the activities of other programs. An application build script is one that invokes compilers, linkers and other tools to compile and link your executable application. As we will see, some build tools are smart enough to understand which pieces of code depend on which others (e.g. which .c files include .h files) and to only recompile what's necessary when small changes are made.
Why use scripts to build your programs?

When you started programming in C++ or in C you probably learned to build your programs this way:

g++ -o myprog myprog.cpp

or

gcc -o myprog myprog.c

These commands use the Gnu compiler to compile a single source file into a runnable Linux executable. Directly calling the compiler this way is perfectly acceptable for simple programs but as you start building more complex programs a number of problems become obvious:

    Most large programs are built from multiple source files. Although it's often possible to name all of these on the command line, doing that is inconvenient.
    You will likely need to set a number of options on the g++ or gcc command line to override compiler defaults, to indicate which directories are to be searched for include files, etc., and you'll have to type those options correctly each time you recompile.
    If your program is big and has lots of source files, recompiling all the pieces each time you make a small change is wasteful.
    You may wish to build several different programs that share some common pieces; in such cases, it's very useful to have a tool that automatically rebuilds everything when shared pieces change.

Application build scripts automate the process of building an application or other program and they can also automate related tasks such as running tests. Build scripts make it much easier to rebuild your program, and that in turn should encourage you to recompile and test frequently as you create your program. Build scripts also help other programmers learn how to recompile and link your code.

In COMP 40, we rely on compile scripts with a known interface to build your homework submissions. That is, when you submit your program you will include a build script, and it must be invokable in just the way we specify. Typically we require a shell script named compile which, when run with no arguments, builds all the code and applications we've asked you to submit. Our test scripts depend on that compile script to build your code for testing. (Some assignments may ask for compile scripts in other forms, such as using a makefile, as described below).
What tools can you use to build your scripts?

In principle, any programming language or tool that can invoke other command line programs can be used to create application build scripts. These include general purpose scripting languages such as Python, PERL and Ruby; shell languages like sh, bash, csh and ksh; and tools like make, mk, ant, raven, maven, etc. that are designed specifically for creating application build scripts. Of these many choices, there are two (or maybe three) that you should know about for COMP 40:

    Shell languages (e.g. sh)

    When you are typing on the console of your Unix login session you are talking to a program known as a shell. This is a program that reads what you type, does some work like expanding filename wildcards, and then invokes the programs you've asked to run. In fact, the shell languages are themselves small prorgramming lanuages; although you usually type one command at a time, you can actually use them to write little loops, if statements, etc. right from the console. The same shell command processors can be used to run shell programs stored in files, but the situation is confused somewhat by the fact that over the years a number of competing shells have been built, each with its own language.

    Regardless of the shell you're running to interpret your console commands, the tradition in COMP 40 is to write compile scripts using the /bin/sh shell language. A section below provides hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh.
    make

    make is the most famous application build language. Although make is somewhat clumsy and ad-hoc in its syntax, it's very powerful and very widely used. If only for that reason, every good programmer should learn to use make.

    The key feature of make and of many other languages designed specifically for building applications is that it allows you to state which pieces of your program depend on which others. When you run make it checks the dates on all your files to determine what's been changed since the last time you built your application, and it rebuilds only files that depend, directly or indirectly, on changed files. You tell make how to do each step in the build process, e.g. how to build multiply.o from multiply.c, and make invokes only the steps that are needed.

    The rules for building each program or application are placed into a file known as a makefile. When you invoke make you can supply the name of the makefile to use:

                 make -f mymakefile myprog
        

    ...will use the makefile named mymakefile to build the program named myprog. If no makefile is named, make will try to find makefile or Makefile (in that order). The following will build myprog using one of those two makefiles.

                 make myprog
        

    When code is distributed for public use it's very common to find a makefile or Makefile along with the code. This is usually a signal that make is the tool to use for building that program.
    mk

    Even Stu Feldman, who many years ago created make, has acknowledged its problems. Among the tools he recommends as an alternative is mk (pronounced "muck"), which was created to support the experimental Plan 9 operating system at Bell Labs.

    The syntax of mk is arguably cleaner and easier to learn than that of make and mk has some powerful features that may be useful when you are building truly complex systems. Norman Ramsey gives a spirited defense of mk in How to Write Compile Scripts.

We may in some cases provide you with tools that are built with make or mk, and you are strongly advised to learn at least the basics of make. It's a skill that will serve you well in your career and one that potential employers may value. Some Hints for writing makefiles are also provided below.

mk is not nearly as widely used as the other tools discussed here but it's got a cleaner design than make and it also is the language we've used behind the scenes to build many of the COMP 40 course materials. You may occasionally see scripts with names like somescript.mk; that .mk suffix likely means that mk is the language being used.
Using build scripts for testing and packaging

Consider using make or other similar tools to integrate testing and packaging with the build process. For example, you might have a make target that does unit testing:

             make test-results

Write your makefile so that the target test-results depends on the executable program(s) being tested. Now if you change some source files and run the above command, make will automatically rebuild your application and immediately run tests on it. That can be a wonderful way to be sure that none of the changes you've made has broken anything that had been working. We strongly encourage you to build your test cases early in the development process and to retest your code after every significant change to the source.

In the same spirit, build targets can be used to invoke tools like valgrind:

             make valgrind-tests

You should have this target depend on an up-to-date build of your system, and then have it run one or more tests of your code using valgrind. Doing this will likely encourage you to run valgrind often, and to be sure that your code is up-to-date when you do.

If you're creating a system that will be distributed to others then a build target to create distribution packages can be very useful:

             make distribution

This would (if necessary) recompile and relink any code that's to be distributed to users in object form and then package the code, perhaps into a tar file, a zip file, or some other form that's convenient for distributing to others.

Of course, all these things can be done equally well with mk or with shell scripts.
Hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh

Here are some hints that may be useful for writing and understanding compile scripts in sh:
Finding documentation on sh

The first place to look for documentation on sh is in the man pages:

man sh

Sometimes doing this gives you the man page for an implementation called bash and indeed on our Tufts CS systems /bin/sh is just a link to /bin/bash; bash has some extensions, but for most of what you'll doing doing sh and bash are compatible. So, either man page is good enough for COMP 40 purposes. In any case, the man pages document the complete syntax of the language and give some instructions for using it. There are also lots of sh and bash tutorials on the Web.
Filename globbing

As we've seen, sh (like bash, csh, tcsh, ksh, etc.) is a language that's designed to interpret commands at an interactive command prompt. One of the services it provides is globbing, in which strings containing characters like * are replaced with a list of filenames matching the expression:

   ls mult*.c    # all files starting with "mult" and ending with .c
   cat [ab]*     # all files starting with "a" or "b"

This is done by replacing the expressions with lists of filenames that become the arguments to commands. So, the second line above might actually turn into the command:

   cat albert anthony.c bertha birtday.html bigdeal.cpp

...if those files happened to be in the current directory. Because sh runs your commands the same way when they come from a script file as from the console, the same globbing is done on every command in your scripts!
Arguments to the script

Your compile script is itself a program that will be invoked (most likely) from the command line. So, your script can be given arguments.

compile -link fgroups

has two arguments: -link and fgroups. You will often see within the compile script code that accesses these parameters. For example:

echo $2

would call the echo command, passing it the second parameter (fgroups for the command above). You can also find out how many parameters there are:

echo $#

echos the number "2", because the script was passed two parameters. You can also work with all the parameters together. If the number of arguments is nargs then:

echo $@    

...is the same as:

echo $1 $2 ... $nargs   

Surprisingly, it's also possible to update the argument list. For example:

shift
echo $@

This would echo only "fgroups", because the shift command shifts all the arguments to the left, and thus "loses" the "-unlink" argument. Such shifting is very commonly done to eliminate arguments such as switches after they have been processed by the script.

set *.c

Somewhat confusingly, the set command completely replaces the command line arguments! After the above command, the original arguments (-link fgroups) are gone, replaced with a list of all .c files. Specifically, globbing is done on *.c, so the set command is given a list of all .c files in the current directory. The set command then sets the argument list to that list of files.

One of the reasons scripts update the argument list is that some important internal script commands default to operating on the argument list:

for cfile 
do
  gcc -c $cfile
done

There are at least two important things to learn from the above example: the for loop iterates over the arguments in $@ (which, after the earlier set command is a list of all the user's .c files). Also, shell scripts have named variables that can be substituted into commands using the $variable_name syntax. So, the above command loops through all the files named in the argument list and calls gcc on each one.

It's also common to set variable names using the = operator. These lines of code are taken from a COMP 40 build script:

CC=gcc

CFLAGS="-I. -I/comp/40/include $CIIFLAGS"
FLAGS="-g -O -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -std=c99 -pedantic"

for cfile 
do
  $CC $FLAGS $CFLAGS -c $cfile
done

You should now be more or less able to understand what commands are executed by that code.
Back quotes

One thing missing from the above is the assignment to $CIIFLAGS. In the actual script, that turns out to use a feature you haven't seen:

CIIFLAGS=`pkg-config --cflags cii40`

Note carefully the backquotes ` surrounding the pkg-config command on the right. Also note that pkg-config has nothing to do with the shell language itself: it's an ordinary command just like gcc, cat or ls.

When a command in a script is in backquotes, the command is run and the output of the command is substituted in place of the quoted command text. So, in this example, the pkg-config command is run with the arguments --cflags cii40; the output of that pkg-config command is assigned to the shell variable CIIFLAGS. (To learn what pkg-config does, try man pkg-config, or else you can just guess that it probably figures out some switches we'll want to pass to the compiler when building something to do with "cii40"...which turns out to be the package name for the Hanson code we use in COMP 40!)
Conditionals

sh has if statements, for loops and many other features of traditional imperative programming languages. You'll need to check the man page for details, but you'll often be able to guess from the syntax what these constructs are doing. One feature for which sh uses a somewhat unusual syntax is conditionals like these::

if [ $linked = no ]; then
  # do something here if variable linked is equal to "no"
fi 

An expression in square brackets is called a conditional, and it evaluates to a boolean true or false. As you can see from the example above, string literals like no need not be quoted unless they contain spaces; variable references must begin with a dollar sign $.

Although the expression in brackets may look like part of the if statement syntax, it's not; the same conditional syntax can be used elsewhere, for example:

[ -n "$2" ] || { echo "You need a second argument to this script" >&2; exit 1; }

Note that the above is of the form: a || b. The expression a, which is the conditional [-n "$2"] is evaluated; if it's false, then expression b on the right is evaluated. That happens to be a compound statement of the form: {stmt1; stmt2;}.

The key to understanding the above example is that [ -n "$2"] is a conditional that tests the length of a string to ensure it's not empty. So, this example writes an error message to standard error only if there is no second argument to the script.

Many conditionals test the existence or nature of named files. for example:


[-e "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists
[-f "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists and is a file (not dir, etc)
[-d "/tmp/somedir"]     # True if /tmp/somedir is a directory

There are many, many other useful conditionals. See the man page for details.
A realistic example

You don't have to understand all of the above in detail on day 1 of COMP 40 but you should rapidly develop an intuition about which parts of each compile script are doing what. That way you will be able to make small modifications to the scripts and to debug them when they break.

Now, take a look at the compile script for a recent version of COMP 40 HW assignments 1; with luck, you'll be able to understand most of what it's doing (several of the fragments above are taken from that script).
The shebang #! convention

This is a good time to learn a Unix scripting techinque that's illustrated on the first line of the sample compile script, which says:

#!/bin/sh

It starts with a #, so the script processor considers it a comment, but it serves a very specific purpose. There are actually two ways you could run this script:

    sh compile -link fgroups: when you do it this way, that first line doesn't matter. You're telling the system to invoke the sh shell and your giving it the name of the script to execute. Whoever does this needs to know that it's an sh script.
    ./compile -link fgroups: done this way, we're treating the script itself as an executable command, but how does Unix know whether to run this using sh (or maybe Python or csh?). That's what that first "shebang" line is for: when you invoke a command that appears to be a text file, Unix (or Linux) looks at the first line. If it starts with:

    #!...some executable name here

    Then the named executable (in our case sh) is run and passed the file as a first argument!

So, we've been able to use our script as if it was a new command named compile (assuming that's the filename of the script). There is one more detail: for this to work you'll need to give your file execute permissions. A likely way to do that is:

chmod u+x compile

which uses the chmod Unix command to indicate that the user (that's the u) who owns the file is to have execute (x) permissions. Of course, you should see man chmod for more information on setting the permission mode.

Oh, and why is it called the "shebang" convention? The "#" character is the "sharp sign" or "hash" (or "number sign"), and the "!" character programmers call "bang". So, shebang. You'll often hear a programmer who's reading a string to another programmer pronounce it in this style: "hash bang slash bin slash usr", etc.

(By the way, if you're not bored yet, you'll surely want to know that the etyomology of the word shebang is surprisingly varied and ambiguous...and if that's not sufficiently obscure detail, the # sign is also known as the octothorpe!)
Hints for writing makefiles

There are many make tutorials and sample makefiles available on the Web. Of course, you should also do man make, and also consult the extensive reference manual for GNU Make (do try to avoid using GNU extensions unless needed). Here we give a short introduction to what make can do.
Tabs and spaces

One important warning about make: tabs and spaces aren't interchangeable!. When you see a rule like this in a makefile:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -o brightness brightness.c

there is a tab character (not spaces!) ahead of the command "gcc" on the second line. If your editor has a feature that replaces tabs with spaces, you'll have to turn that off when editing makefiles! (This is just an example of why people complain about make. Still, it's a very powerful tool that can do very useful things for you.)
Variables

Like shell scripts, makefiles allow you to set and substitute named variables:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: $(EXECUTABLES)

is more or less equivalent to:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: brightness fgroups

Targets and Dependencies

Consider again that same fragment:

all: brightness fgroups

This tells make that if the user says:

make all

...then it's necessary to ensure that fgroups and brightness are up to date. We say that the target all depends on fgroups and brightness. But how can the make system know whether those program(s) actually need to be rebuilt? Somewhere in the makefile should be another rule telling what those two programs depend on, and how to build them. A very simple rule might be:

brightness: brightness.o
    gcc -o brightness brightness.o 

which says to build brightness by linking brightness.o. Note that each rule starts with a target name in the left margin, followed by a colon, and optionally followed by any dependencies. If there are one or more commands needed to build the target, they are listed below, with tabs starting each such line.

Of course, we then need a rule for being sure that brightness.o is up to date, and telling us how to build that:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -c brightness.c

So, what happens if we issue the command "make brightness"? Make starts by building a tree of dependencies. What do we need to build brightness? Answer: an up-to-date brightness.o. What do we need to build that? There's another rule that tells us, and so on. After building the whole tree of dependencies the system will decide that the first check to be made is whether brightness.c been changed since brightness.o was last built. and if so that code will be recompiled. Then, if the brightness exectuable is older than the (possibly recompiled) brightness.o, the executable is relinked. In short, only necessary work is done.

Note that, unlike a script, a makefile is not a list of steps to be performed in order; it's a set of rules, and each rule is considered as needed according to the circumstance. Rules are chosen by pattern matching on filenames and by checking whether any dependencies must be rebuilt. Once a rule is chosen, there may indeed be one or more steps (actually zero or more) specified to build the target.
Pattern rules and automatic variables

Make has many many other sophisticated features, but there's one more you should learn early. Consider this fragment:

# 
#    To get any .o, compile the corresponding .c
#
%.o:%.c 
    gcc $(FLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

Our first approach required a separate rule for each .o, but all of those rules look almost the same. The fragment above uses what make calls pattern rules (e.g. %.c) and automatic variables (e.g. $<). You'll have to read the GNU make documentation for all the details, but what the fragment above says is:

    Every .o file depends on the corresponding .c file
    The name of that .c file is substituted into the gcc command after the -c option

So, a single rule suffices to build a .o file from any corresponding .c file. Also shown in the gcc command line is the substitution of two variables FLAGS and CFLAGS that we can assume have been set with the compiler options that we're using on this project. We can thus ensure that the same compiler options are automatically applied to each compilation. Obviously we can (and should) do something similar on the commands that link the executables.
A realistic example

Appendix II contains a makefile that builds HW assignments 1. With the hints given above you should be able to figure out most of what it's doing.

Right now, the COMP 40 homework submission process expects a compile script not a makefile; you should be sure to provide a working compile script or else your homework may not be graded. Still it's good to know how makefiles work, and we may sometime soon switch to using them for some assignments.
Build scripts as documentation

Like any other code you write, your build scripts and makefiles should be designed as documentation to be read by other programmers. Especially if you use languages like make or mk, your build scripts formally document which pieces of your system depend on which others. Of course, your scripts also document the compiler switches and other settings used.

Make sure your build scripts are cleanly structured and easy to read. When it's not obvious from the code, include comments explaining what various build targets do, and any other information that might be needed by someone maintaining or modifying your code. Be especially careful to document non-obvious dependencies on tools or libraries, e.g.:

# This build runs against the grapics library 
# version 2.8, which is current as of July, 2013.  The 
# program depends on features such as double buffering
# introduced in v2.8.  
# NEEDSWORK We should add an automatic configuration 
# test to ensure double buffering is available.

APPENDIX I: A COMP 40 Compile Script

APPENDIX II: A COMP 40 Makefile

The following makefile is more or less equivalent to the compile script shown above in Appendex I. Like that script, this makefile defaults to building the brightness and fgroups executables. So, if we assume this file is called Makefile, here are some commands we could issue:

make all          # builds fgroups and brightness and any needed .o files
make              # same as "make all" because all is the default target
make brightness   # builds brightness, and any .o files that needs
make fgroups.o    # recompiles fgroups.o only if fgroups.c is changed
make clean        # remove all .o files and executables fgroups and brightness

Here is the sample makefile:

#            Makefile for COMP 40 Homework 1
#
#     Author: Noah Mendelsohn (adapted from Norman Ramsey's compile script)
#
#  Maintenance targets:
#
#
#    all         - (default target) make sure everything's compiled
#    clean       - clean out all compiled object and executable files
#    brightness  - compile just the brightness program
#    fgroups     - compile just the fingerprint group program.
#
#

# Executables to built using "make all"

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

#
#  The following is a compromise. You MUST list all your .h files here.
#  If any .h file changes, all .c files will be recompiled. To do better,
#  we could make an explicit target for each .o, naming only the .h
#  files it really uses.
#
# Add your own .h files to the right side of the assingment below.

#

#
#    Note that "all" is the default target that make will build
#    if nothing is specifically requested
#

# 
#    'make clean' will remove all object and executable files

What is a script?

In computing, the term script refers to a program that invokes and coordinates the activities of other programs. An application build script is one that invokes compilers, linkers and other tools to compile and link your executable application. As we will see, some build tools are smart enough to understand which pieces of code depend on which others (e.g. which .c files include .h files) and to only recompile what's necessary when small changes are made.
Why use scripts to build your programs?

When you started programming in C++ or in C you probably learned to build your programs this way:

g++ -o myprog myprog.cpp

or

gcc -o myprog myprog.c

These commands use the Gnu compiler to compile a single source file into a runnable Linux executable. Directly calling the compiler this way is perfectly acceptable for simple programs but as you start building more complex programs a number of problems become obvious:

    Most large programs are built from multiple source files. Although it's often possible to name all of these on the command line, doing that is inconvenient.
    You will likely need to set a number of options on the g++ or gcc command line to override compiler defaults, to indicate which directories are to be searched for include files, etc., and you'll have to type those options correctly each time you recompile.
    If your program is big and has lots of source files, recompiling all the pieces each time you make a small change is wasteful.
    You may wish to build several different programs that share some common pieces; in such cases, it's very useful to have a tool that automatically rebuilds everything when shared pieces change.

Application build scripts automate the process of building an application or other program and they can also automate related tasks such as running tests. Build scripts make it much easier to rebuild your program, and that in turn should encourage you to recompile and test frequently as you create your program. Build scripts also help other programmers learn how to recompile and link your code.

In COMP 40, we rely on compile scripts with a known interface to build your homework submissions. That is, when you submit your program you will include a build script, and it must be invokable in just the way we specify. Typically we require a shell script named compile which, when run with no arguments, builds all the code and applications we've asked you to submit. Our test scripts depend on that compile script to build your code for testing. (Some assignments may ask for compile scripts in other forms, such as using a makefile, as described below).
What tools can you use to build your scripts?

In principle, any programming language or tool that can invoke other command line programs can be used to create application build scripts. These include general purpose scripting languages such as Python, PERL and Ruby; shell languages like sh, bash, csh and ksh; and tools like make, mk, ant, raven, maven, etc. that are designed specifically for creating application build scripts. Of these many choices, there are two (or maybe three) that you should know about for COMP 40:

    Shell languages (e.g. sh)

    When you are typing on the console of your Unix login session you are talking to a program known as a shell. This is a program that reads what you type, does some work like expanding filename wildcards, and then invokes the programs you've asked to run. In fact, the shell languages are themselves small prorgramming lanuages; although you usually type one command at a time, you can actually use them to write little loops, if statements, etc. right from the console. The same shell command processors can be used to run shell programs stored in files, but the situation is confused somewhat by the fact that over the years a number of competing shells have been built, each with its own language.

    Regardless of the shell you're running to interpret your console commands, the tradition in COMP 40 is to write compile scripts using the /bin/sh shell language. A section below provides hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh.
    make

    make is the most famous application build language. Although make is somewhat clumsy and ad-hoc in its syntax, it's very powerful and very widely used. If only for that reason, every good programmer should learn to use make.

    The key feature of make and of many other languages designed specifically for building applications is that it allows you to state which pieces of your program depend on which others. When you run make it checks the dates on all your files to determine what's been changed since the last time you built your application, and it rebuilds only files that depend, directly or indirectly, on changed files. You tell make how to do each step in the build process, e.g. how to build multiply.o from multiply.c, and make invokes only the steps that are needed.

    The rules for building each program or application are placed into a file known as a makefile. When you invoke make you can supply the name of the makefile to use:

                 make -f mymakefile myprog
        

    ...will use the makefile named mymakefile to build the program named myprog. If no makefile is named, make will try to find makefile or Makefile (in that order). The following will build myprog using one of those two makefiles.

                 make myprog
        

    When code is distributed for public use it's very common to find a makefile or Makefile along with the code. This is usually a signal that make is the tool to use for building that program.
    mk

    Even Stu Feldman, who many years ago created make, has acknowledged its problems. Among the tools he recommends as an alternative is mk (pronounced "muck"), which was created to support the experimental Plan 9 operating system at Bell Labs.

    The syntax of mk is arguably cleaner and easier to learn than that of make and mk has some powerful features that may be useful when you are building truly complex systems. Norman Ramsey gives a spirited defense of mk in How to Write Compile Scripts.

We may in some cases provide you with tools that are built with make or mk, and you are strongly advised to learn at least the basics of make. It's a skill that will serve you well in your career and one that potential employers may value. Some Hints for writing makefiles are also provided below.

mk is not nearly as widely used as the other tools discussed here but it's got a cleaner design than make and it also is the language we've used behind the scenes to build many of the COMP 40 course materials. You may occasionally see scripts with names like somescript.mk; that .mk suffix likely means that mk is the language being used.
Using build scripts for testing and packaging

Consider using make or other similar tools to integrate testing and packaging with the build process. For example, you might have a make target that does unit testing:

             make test-results

Write your makefile so that the target test-results depends on the executable program(s) being tested. Now if you change some source files and run the above command, make will automatically rebuild your application and immediately run tests on it. That can be a wonderful way to be sure that none of the changes you've made has broken anything that had been working. We strongly encourage you to build your test cases early in the development process and to retest your code after every significant change to the source.

In the same spirit, build targets can be used to invoke tools like valgrind:

             make valgrind-tests

You should have this target depend on an up-to-date build of your system, and then have it run one or more tests of your code using valgrind. Doing this will likely encourage you to run valgrind often, and to be sure that your code is up-to-date when you do.

If you're creating a system that will be distributed to others then a build target to create distribution packages can be very useful:

             make distribution

This would (if necessary) recompile and relink any code that's to be distributed to users in object form and then package the code, perhaps into a tar file, a zip file, or some other form that's convenient for distributing to others.

Of course, all these things can be done equally well with mk or with shell scripts.
Hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh

Here are some hints that may be useful for writing and understanding compile scripts in sh:
Finding documentation on sh

The first place to look for documentation on sh is in the man pages:

man sh

Sometimes doing this gives you the man page for an implementation called bash and indeed on our Tufts CS systems /bin/sh is just a link to /bin/bash; bash has some extensions, but for most of what you'll doing doing sh and bash are compatible. So, either man page is good enough for COMP 40 purposes. In any case, the man pages document the complete syntax of the language and give some instructions for using it. There are also lots of sh and bash tutorials on the Web.
Filename globbing

As we've seen, sh (like bash, csh, tcsh, ksh, etc.) is a language that's designed to interpret commands at an interactive command prompt. One of the services it provides is globbing, in which strings containing characters like * are replaced with a list of filenames matching the expression:

   ls mult*.c    # all files starting with "mult" and ending with .c
   cat [ab]*     # all files starting with "a" or "b"

This is done by replacing the expressions with lists of filenames that become the arguments to commands. So, the second line above might actually turn into the command:

   cat albert anthony.c bertha birtday.html bigdeal.cpp

...if those files happened to be in the current directory. Because sh runs your commands the same way when they come from a script file as from the console, the same globbing is done on every command in your scripts!
Arguments to the script

Your compile script is itself a program that will be invoked (most likely) from the command line. So, your script can be given arguments.

compile -link fgroups

has two arguments: -link and fgroups. You will often see within the compile script code that accesses these parameters. For example:

echo $2

would call the echo command, passing it the second parameter (fgroups for the command above). You can also find out how many parameters there are:

echo $#

echos the number "2", because the script was passed two parameters. You can also work with all the parameters together. If the number of arguments is nargs then:

echo $@    

...is the same as:

echo $1 $2 ... $nargs   

Surprisingly, it's also possible to update the argument list. For example:

shift
echo $@

This would echo only "fgroups", because the shift command shifts all the arguments to the left, and thus "loses" the "-unlink" argument. Such shifting is very commonly done to eliminate arguments such as switches after they have been processed by the script.

set *.c

Somewhat confusingly, the set command completely replaces the command line arguments! After the above command, the original arguments (-link fgroups) are gone, replaced with a list of all .c files. Specifically, globbing is done on *.c, so the set command is given a list of all .c files in the current directory. The set command then sets the argument list to that list of files.

One of the reasons scripts update the argument list is that some important internal script commands default to operating on the argument list:

for cfile 
do
  gcc -c $cfile
done

There are at least two important things to learn from the above example: the for loop iterates over the arguments in $@ (which, after the earlier set command is a list of all the user's .c files). Also, shell scripts have named variables that can be substituted into commands using the $variable_name syntax. So, the above command loops through all the files named in the argument list and calls gcc on each one.

It's also common to set variable names using the = operator. These lines of code are taken from a COMP 40 build script:

CC=gcc

CFLAGS="-I. -I/comp/40/include $CIIFLAGS"
FLAGS="-g -O -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -std=c99 -pedantic"

for cfile 
do
  $CC $FLAGS $CFLAGS -c $cfile
done

You should now be more or less able to understand what commands are executed by that code.
Back quotes

One thing missing from the above is the assignment to $CIIFLAGS. In the actual script, that turns out to use a feature you haven't seen:

CIIFLAGS=`pkg-config --cflags cii40`

Note carefully the backquotes ` surrounding the pkg-config command on the right. Also note that pkg-config has nothing to do with the shell language itself: it's an ordinary command just like gcc, cat or ls.

When a command in a script is in backquotes, the command is run and the output of the command is substituted in place of the quoted command text. So, in this example, the pkg-config command is run with the arguments --cflags cii40; the output of that pkg-config command is assigned to the shell variable CIIFLAGS. (To learn what pkg-config does, try man pkg-config, or else you can just guess that it probably figures out some switches we'll want to pass to the compiler when building something to do with "cii40"...which turns out to be the package name for the Hanson code we use in COMP 40!)
Conditionals

sh has if statements, for loops and many other features of traditional imperative programming languages. You'll need to check the man page for details, but you'll often be able to guess from the syntax what these constructs are doing. One feature for which sh uses a somewhat unusual syntax is conditionals like these::

if [ $linked = no ]; then
  # do something here if variable linked is equal to "no"
fi 

An expression in square brackets is called a conditional, and it evaluates to a boolean true or false. As you can see from the example above, string literals like no need not be quoted unless they contain spaces; variable references must begin with a dollar sign $.

Although the expression in brackets may look like part of the if statement syntax, it's not; the same conditional syntax can be used elsewhere, for example:

[ -n "$2" ] || { echo "You need a second argument to this script" >&2; exit 1; }

Note that the above is of the form: a || b. The expression a, which is the conditional [-n "$2"] is evaluated; if it's false, then expression b on the right is evaluated. That happens to be a compound statement of the form: {stmt1; stmt2;}.

The key to understanding the above example is that [ -n "$2"] is a conditional that tests the length of a string to ensure it's not empty. So, this example writes an error message to standard error only if there is no second argument to the script.

Many conditionals test the existence or nature of named files. for example:


[-e "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists
[-f "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists and is a file (not dir, etc)
[-d "/tmp/somedir"]     # True if /tmp/somedir is a directory

There are many, many other useful conditionals. See the man page for details.
A realistic example

You don't have to understand all of the above in detail on day 1 of COMP 40 but you should rapidly develop an intuition about which parts of each compile script are doing what. That way you will be able to make small modifications to the scripts and to debug them when they break.

Now, take a look at the compile script for a recent version of COMP 40 HW assignments 1; with luck, you'll be able to understand most of what it's doing (several of the fragments above are taken from that script).
The shebang #! convention

This is a good time to learn a Unix scripting techinque that's illustrated on the first line of the sample compile script, which says:

#!/bin/sh

It starts with a #, so the script processor considers it a comment, but it serves a very specific purpose. There are actually two ways you could run this script:

    sh compile -link fgroups: when you do it this way, that first line doesn't matter. You're telling the system to invoke the sh shell and your giving it the name of the script to execute. Whoever does this needs to know that it's an sh script.
    ./compile -link fgroups: done this way, we're treating the script itself as an executable command, but how does Unix know whether to run this using sh (or maybe Python or csh?). That's what that first "shebang" line is for: when you invoke a command that appears to be a text file, Unix (or Linux) looks at the first line. If it starts with:

    #!...some executable name here

    Then the named executable (in our case sh) is run and passed the file as a first argument!

So, we've been able to use our script as if it was a new command named compile (assuming that's the filename of the script). There is one more detail: for this to work you'll need to give your file execute permissions. A likely way to do that is:

chmod u+x compile

which uses the chmod Unix command to indicate that the user (that's the u) who owns the file is to have execute (x) permissions. Of course, you should see man chmod for more information on setting the permission mode.

Oh, and why is it called the "shebang" convention? The "#" character is the "sharp sign" or "hash" (or "number sign"), and the "!" character programmers call "bang". So, shebang. You'll often hear a programmer who's reading a string to another programmer pronounce it in this style: "hash bang slash bin slash usr", etc.

(By the way, if you're not bored yet, you'll surely want to know that the etyomology of the word shebang is surprisingly varied and ambiguous...and if that's not sufficiently obscure detail, the # sign is also known as the octothorpe!)
Hints for writing makefiles

There are many make tutorials and sample makefiles available on the Web. Of course, you should also do man make, and also consult the extensive reference manual for GNU Make (do try to avoid using GNU extensions unless needed). Here we give a short introduction to what make can do.
Tabs and spaces

One important warning about make: tabs and spaces aren't interchangeable!. When you see a rule like this in a makefile:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -o brightness brightness.c

there is a tab character (not spaces!) ahead of the command "gcc" on the second line. If your editor has a feature that replaces tabs with spaces, you'll have to turn that off when editing makefiles! (This is just an example of why people complain about make. Still, it's a very powerful tool that can do very useful things for you.)
Variables

Like shell scripts, makefiles allow you to set and substitute named variables:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: $(EXECUTABLES)

is more or less equivalent to:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: brightness fgroups

Targets and Dependencies

Consider again that same fragment:

all: brightness fgroups

This tells make that if the user says:

make all

...then it's necessary to ensure that fgroups and brightness are up to date. We say that the target all depends on fgroups and brightness. But how can the make system know whether those program(s) actually need to be rebuilt? Somewhere in the makefile should be another rule telling what those two programs depend on, and how to build them. A very simple rule might be:

brightness: brightness.o
    gcc -o brightness brightness.o 

which says to build brightness by linking brightness.o. Note that each rule starts with a target name in the left margin, followed by a colon, and optionally followed by any dependencies. If there are one or more commands needed to build the target, they are listed below, with tabs starting each such line.

Of course, we then need a rule for being sure that brightness.o is up to date, and telling us how to build that:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -c brightness.c

So, what happens if we issue the command "make brightness"? Make starts by building a tree of dependencies. What do we need to build brightness? Answer: an up-to-date brightness.o. What do we need to build that? There's another rule that tells us, and so on. After building the whole tree of dependencies the system will decide that the first check to be made is whether brightness.c been changed since brightness.o was last built. and if so that code will be recompiled. Then, if the brightness exectuable is older than the (possibly recompiled) brightness.o, the executable is relinked. In short, only necessary work is done.

Note that, unlike a script, a makefile is not a list of steps to be performed in order; it's a set of rules, and each rule is considered as needed according to the circumstance. Rules are chosen by pattern matching on filenames and by checking whether any dependencies must be rebuilt. Once a rule is chosen, there may indeed be one or more steps (actually zero or more) specified to build the target.
Pattern rules and automatic variables

Make has many many other sophisticated features, but there's one more you should learn early. Consider this fragment:

# 
#    To get any .o, compile the corresponding .c
#
%.o:%.c 
    gcc $(FLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

Our first approach required a separate rule for each .o, but all of those rules look almost the same. The fragment above uses what make calls pattern rules (e.g. %.c) and automatic variables (e.g. $<). You'll have to read the GNU make documentation for all the details, but what the fragment above says is:

    Every .o file depends on the corresponding .c file
    The name of that .c file is substituted into the gcc command after the -c option

So, a single rule suffices to build a .o file from any corresponding .c file. Also shown in the gcc command line is the substitution of two variables FLAGS and CFLAGS that we can assume have been set with the compiler options that we're using on this project. We can thus ensure that the same compiler options are automatically applied to each compilation. Obviously we can (and should) do something similar on the commands that link the executables.
A realistic example

Appendix II contains a makefile that builds HW assignments 1. With the hints given above you should be able to figure out most of what it's doing.

Right now, the COMP 40 homework submission process expects a compile script not a makefile; you should be sure to provide a working compile script or else your homework may not be graded. Still it's good to know how makefiles work, and we may sometime soon switch to using them for some assignments.
Build scripts as documentation

Like any other code you write, your build scripts and makefiles should be designed as documentation to be read by other programmers. Especially if you use languages like make or mk, your build scripts formally document which pieces of your system depend on which others. Of course, your scripts also document the compiler switches and other settings used.

Make sure your build scripts are cleanly structured and easy to read. When it's not obvious from the code, include comments explaining what various build targets do, and any other information that might be needed by someone maintaining or modifying your code. Be especially careful to document non-obvious dependencies on tools or libraries, e.g.:

# This build runs against the grapics library 
# version 2.8, which is current as of July, 2013.  The 
# program depends on features such as double buffering
# introduced in v2.8.  
# NEEDSWORK We should add an automatic configuration 
# test to ensure double buffering is available.

APPENDIX I: A COMP 40 Compile Script

APPENDIX II: A COMP 40 Makefile

The following makefile is more or less equivalent to the compile script shown above in Appendex I. Like that script, this makefile defaults to building the brightness and fgroups executables. So, if we assume this file is called Makefile, here are some commands we could issue:

make all          # builds fgroups and brightness and any needed .o files
make              # same as "make all" because all is the default target
make brightness   # builds brightness, and any .o files that needs
make fgroups.o    # recompiles fgroups.o only if fgroups.c is changed
make clean        # remove all .o files and executables fgroups and brightness

Here is the sample makefile:

#            Makefile for COMP 40 Homework 1
#
#     Author: Noah Mendelsohn (adapted from Norman Ramsey's compile script)
#
#  Maintenance targets:
#
#
#    all         - (default target) make sure everything's compiled
#    clean       - clean out all compiled object and executable files
#    brightness  - compile just the brightness program
#    fgroups     - compile just the fingerprint group program.
#
#

# Executables to built using "make all"

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

#
#  The following is a compromise. You MUST list all your .h files here.
#  If any .h file changes, all .c files will be recompiled. To do better,
#  we could make an explicit target for each .o, naming only the .h
#  files it really uses.

What is a script?

In computing, the term script refers to a program that invokes and coordinates the activities of other programs. An application build script is one that invokes compilers, linkers and other tools to compile and link your executable application. As we will see, some build tools are smart enough to understand which pieces of code depend on which others (e.g. which .c files include .h files) and to only recompile what's necessary when small changes are made.
Why use scripts to build your programs?

When you started programming in C++ or in C you probably learned to build your programs this way:

g++ -o myprog myprog.cpp

or

gcc -o myprog myprog.c

These commands use the Gnu compiler to compile a single source file into a runnable Linux executable. Directly calling the compiler this way is perfectly acceptable for simple programs but as you start building more complex programs a number of problems become obvious:

    Most large programs are built from multiple source files. Although it's often possible to name all of these on the command line, doing that is inconvenient.
    You will likely need to set a number of options on the g++ or gcc command line to override compiler defaults, to indicate which directories are to be searched for include files, etc., and you'll have to type those options correctly each time you recompile.
    If your program is big and has lots of source files, recompiling all the pieces each time you make a small change is wasteful.
    You may wish to build several different programs that share some common pieces; in such cases, it's very useful to have a tool that automatically rebuilds everything when shared pieces change.

Application build scripts automate the process of building an application or other program and they can also automate related tasks such as running tests. Build scripts make it much easier to rebuild your program, and that in turn should encourage you to recompile and test frequently as you create your program. Build scripts also help other programmers learn how to recompile and link your code.

In COMP 40, we rely on compile scripts with a known interface to build your homework submissions. That is, when you submit your program you will include a build script, and it must be invokable in just the way we specify. Typically we require a shell script named compile which, when run with no arguments, builds all the code and applications we've asked you to submit. Our test scripts depend on that compile script to build your code for testing. (Some assignments may ask for compile scripts in other forms, such as using a makefile, as described below).
What tools can you use to build your scripts?

In principle, any programming language or tool that can invoke other command line programs can be used to create application build scripts. These include general purpose scripting languages such as Python, PERL and Ruby; shell languages like sh, bash, csh and ksh; and tools like make, mk, ant, raven, maven, etc. that are designed specifically for creating application build scripts. Of these many choices, there are two (or maybe three) that you should know about for COMP 40:

    Shell languages (e.g. sh)

    When you are typing on the console of your Unix login session you are talking to a program known as a shell. This is a program that reads what you type, does some work like expanding filename wildcards, and then invokes the programs you've asked to run. In fact, the shell languages are themselves small prorgramming lanuages; although you usually type one command at a time, you can actually use them to write little loops, if statements, etc. right from the console. The same shell command processors can be used to run shell programs stored in files, but the situation is confused somewhat by the fact that over the years a number of competing shells have been built, each with its own language.

    Regardless of the shell you're running to interpret your console commands, the tradition in COMP 40 is to write compile scripts using the /bin/sh shell language. A section below provides hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh.
    make

    make is the most famous application build language. Although make is somewhat clumsy and ad-hoc in its syntax, it's very powerful and very widely used. If only for that reason, every good programmer should learn to use make.

    The key feature of make and of many other languages designed specifically for building applications is that it allows you to state which pieces of your program depend on which others. When you run make it checks the dates on all your files to determine what's been changed since the last time you built your application, and it rebuilds only files that depend, directly or indirectly, on changed files. You tell make how to do each step in the build process, e.g. how to build multiply.o from multiply.c, and make invokes only the steps that are needed.

    The rules for building each program or application are placed into a file known as a makefile. When you invoke make you can supply the name of the makefile to use:

                 make -f mymakefile myprog
        

    ...will use the makefile named mymakefile to build the program named myprog. If no makefile is named, make will try to find makefile or Makefile (in that order). The following will build myprog using one of those two makefiles.

                 make myprog
        

    When code is distributed for public use it's very common to find a makefile or Makefile along with the code. This is usually a signal that make is the tool to use for building that program.
    mk

    Even Stu Feldman, who many years ago created make, has acknowledged its problems. Among the tools he recommends as an alternative is mk (pronounced "muck"), which was created to support the experimental Plan 9 operating system at Bell Labs.

    The syntax of mk is arguably cleaner and easier to learn than that of make and mk has some powerful features that may be useful when you are building truly complex systems. Norman Ramsey gives a spirited defense of mk in How to Write Compile Scripts.

We may in some cases provide you with tools that are built with make or mk, and you are strongly advised to learn at least the basics of make. It's a skill that will serve you well in your career and one that potential employers may value. Some Hints for writing makefiles are also provided below.

mk is not nearly as widely used as the other tools discussed here but it's got a cleaner design than make and it also is the language we've used behind the scenes to build many of the COMP 40 course materials. You may occasionally see scripts with names like somescript.mk; that .mk suffix likely means that mk is the language being used.
Using build scripts for testing and packaging

Consider using make or other similar tools to integrate testing and packaging with the build process. For example, you might have a make target that does unit testing:

             make test-results

Write your makefile so that the target test-results depends on the executable program(s) being tested. Now if you change some source files and run the above command, make will automatically rebuild your application and immediately run tests on it. That can be a wonderful way to be sure that none of the changes you've made has broken anything that had been working. We strongly encourage you to build your test cases early in the development process and to retest your code after every significant change to the source.

In the same spirit, build targets can be used to invoke tools like valgrind:

             make valgrind-tests

You should have this target depend on an up-to-date build of your system, and then have it run one or more tests of your code using valgrind. Doing this will likely encourage you to run valgrind often, and to be sure that your code is up-to-date when you do.

If you're creating a system that will be distributed to others then a build target to create distribution packages can be very useful:

             make distribution

This would (if necessary) recompile and relink any code that's to be distributed to users in object form and then package the code, perhaps into a tar file, a zip file, or some other form that's convenient for distributing to others.

Of course, all these things can be done equally well with mk or with shell scripts.
Hints for writing and understanding compile scripts written in sh

Here are some hints that may be useful for writing and understanding compile scripts in sh:
Finding documentation on sh

The first place to look for documentation on sh is in the man pages:

man sh

Sometimes doing this gives you the man page for an implementation called bash and indeed on our Tufts CS systems /bin/sh is just a link to /bin/bash; bash has some extensions, but for most of what you'll doing doing sh and bash are compatible. So, either man page is good enough for COMP 40 purposes. In any case, the man pages document the complete syntax of the language and give some instructions for using it. There are also lots of sh and bash tutorials on the Web.
Filename globbing

As we've seen, sh (like bash, csh, tcsh, ksh, etc.) is a language that's designed to interpret commands at an interactive command prompt. One of the services it provides is globbing, in which strings containing characters like * are replaced with a list of filenames matching the expression:

   ls mult*.c    # all files starting with "mult" and ending with .c
   cat [ab]*     # all files starting with "a" or "b"

This is done by replacing the expressions with lists of filenames that become the arguments to commands. So, the second line above might actually turn into the command:

   cat albert anthony.c bertha birtday.html bigdeal.cpp

...if those files happened to be in the current directory. Because sh runs your commands the same way when they come from a script file as from the console, the same globbing is done on every command in your scripts!
Arguments to the script

Your compile script is itself a program that will be invoked (most likely) from the command line. So, your script can be given arguments.

compile -link fgroups

has two arguments: -link and fgroups. You will often see within the compile script code that accesses these parameters. For example:

echo $2

would call the echo command, passing it the second parameter (fgroups for the command above). You can also find out how many parameters there are:

echo $#

echos the number "2", because the script was passed two parameters. You can also work with all the parameters together. If the number of arguments is nargs then:

echo $@    

...is the same as:

echo $1 $2 ... $nargs   

Surprisingly, it's also possible to update the argument list. For example:

shift
echo $@

This would echo only "fgroups", because the shift command shifts all the arguments to the left, and thus "loses" the "-unlink" argument. Such shifting is very commonly done to eliminate arguments such as switches after they have been processed by the script.

set *.c

Somewhat confusingly, the set command completely replaces the command line arguments! After the above command, the original arguments (-link fgroups) are gone, replaced with a list of all .c files. Specifically, globbing is done on *.c, so the set command is given a list of all .c files in the current directory. The set command then sets the argument list to that list of files.

One of the reasons scripts update the argument list is that some important internal script commands default to operating on the argument list:

for cfile 
do
  gcc -c $cfile
done

There are at least two important things to learn from the above example: the for loop iterates over the arguments in $@ (which, after the earlier set command is a list of all the user's .c files). Also, shell scripts have named variables that can be substituted into commands using the $variable_name syntax. So, the above command loops through all the files named in the argument list and calls gcc on each one.

It's also common to set variable names using the = operator. These lines of code are taken from a COMP 40 build script:

CC=gcc

CFLAGS="-I. -I/comp/40/include $CIIFLAGS"
FLAGS="-g -O -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -std=c99 -pedantic"

for cfile 
do
  $CC $FLAGS $CFLAGS -c $cfile
done

You should now be more or less able to understand what commands are executed by that code.
Back quotes

One thing missing from the above is the assignment to $CIIFLAGS. In the actual script, that turns out to use a feature you haven't seen:

CIIFLAGS=`pkg-config --cflags cii40`

Note carefully the backquotes ` surrounding the pkg-config command on the right. Also note that pkg-config has nothing to do with the shell language itself: it's an ordinary command just like gcc, cat or ls.

When a command in a script is in backquotes, the command is run and the output of the command is substituted in place of the quoted command text. So, in this example, the pkg-config command is run with the arguments --cflags cii40; the output of that pkg-config command is assigned to the shell variable CIIFLAGS. (To learn what pkg-config does, try man pkg-config, or else you can just guess that it probably figures out some switches we'll want to pass to the compiler when building something to do with "cii40"...which turns out to be the package name for the Hanson code we use in COMP 40!)
Conditionals

sh has if statements, for loops and many other features of traditional imperative programming languages. You'll need to check the man page for details, but you'll often be able to guess from the syntax what these constructs are doing. One feature for which sh uses a somewhat unusual syntax is conditionals like these::

if [ $linked = no ]; then
  # do something here if variable linked is equal to "no"
fi 

An expression in square brackets is called a conditional, and it evaluates to a boolean true or false. As you can see from the example above, string literals like no need not be quoted unless they contain spaces; variable references must begin with a dollar sign $.

Although the expression in brackets may look like part of the if statement syntax, it's not; the same conditional syntax can be used elsewhere, for example:

[ -n "$2" ] || { echo "You need a second argument to this script" >&2; exit 1; }

Note that the above is of the form: a || b. The expression a, which is the conditional [-n "$2"] is evaluated; if it's false, then expression b on the right is evaluated. That happens to be a compound statement of the form: {stmt1; stmt2;}.

The key to understanding the above example is that [ -n "$2"] is a conditional that tests the length of a string to ensure it's not empty. So, this example writes an error message to standard error only if there is no second argument to the script.

Many conditionals test the existence or nature of named files. for example:


[-e "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists
[-f "/tmp/somefile"]    # True if /tmp/somefile exists and is a file (not dir, etc)
[-d "/tmp/somedir"]     # True if /tmp/somedir is a directory

There are many, many other useful conditionals. See the man page for details.
A realistic example

You don't have to understand all of the above in detail on day 1 of COMP 40 but you should rapidly develop an intuition about which parts of each compile script are doing what. That way you will be able to make small modifications to the scripts and to debug them when they break.

Now, take a look at the compile script for a recent version of COMP 40 HW assignments 1; with luck, you'll be able to understand most of what it's doing (several of the fragments above are taken from that script).
The shebang #! convention

This is a good time to learn a Unix scripting techinque that's illustrated on the first line of the sample compile script, which says:

#!/bin/sh

It starts with a #, so the script processor considers it a comment, but it serves a very specific purpose. There are actually two ways you could run this script:

    sh compile -link fgroups: when you do it this way, that first line doesn't matter. You're telling the system to invoke the sh shell and your giving it the name of the script to execute. Whoever does this needs to know that it's an sh script.
    ./compile -link fgroups: done this way, we're treating the script itself as an executable command, but how does Unix know whether to run this using sh (or maybe Python or csh?). That's what that first "shebang" line is for: when you invoke a command that appears to be a text file, Unix (or Linux) looks at the first line. If it starts with:

    #!...some executable name here

    Then the named executable (in our case sh) is run and passed the file as a first argument!

So, we've been able to use our script as if it was a new command named compile (assuming that's the filename of the script). There is one more detail: for this to work you'll need to give your file execute permissions. A likely way to do that is:

chmod u+x compile

which uses the chmod Unix command to indicate that the user (that's the u) who owns the file is to have execute (x) permissions. Of course, you should see man chmod for more information on setting the permission mode.

Oh, and why is it called the "shebang" convention? The "#" character is the "sharp sign" or "hash" (or "number sign"), and the "!" character programmers call "bang". So, shebang. You'll often hear a programmer who's reading a string to another programmer pronounce it in this style: "hash bang slash bin slash usr", etc.

(By the way, if you're not bored yet, you'll surely want to know that the etyomology of the word shebang is surprisingly varied and ambiguous...and if that's not sufficiently obscure detail, the # sign is also known as the octothorpe!)
Hints for writing makefiles

There are many make tutorials and sample makefiles available on the Web. Of course, you should also do man make, and also consult the extensive reference manual for GNU Make (do try to avoid using GNU extensions unless needed). Here we give a short introduction to what make can do.
Tabs and spaces

One important warning about make: tabs and spaces aren't interchangeable!. When you see a rule like this in a makefile:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -o brightness brightness.c

there is a tab character (not spaces!) ahead of the command "gcc" on the second line. If your editor has a feature that replaces tabs with spaces, you'll have to turn that off when editing makefiles! (This is just an example of why people complain about make. Still, it's a very powerful tool that can do very useful things for you.)
Variables

Like shell scripts, makefiles allow you to set and substitute named variables:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: $(EXECUTABLES)

is more or less equivalent to:

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

all: brightness fgroups

Targets and Dependencies

Consider again that same fragment:

all: brightness fgroups

This tells make that if the user says:

make all

...then it's necessary to ensure that fgroups and brightness are up to date. We say that the target all depends on fgroups and brightness. But how can the make system know whether those program(s) actually need to be rebuilt? Somewhere in the makefile should be another rule telling what those two programs depend on, and how to build them. A very simple rule might be:

brightness: brightness.o
    gcc -o brightness brightness.o 

which says to build brightness by linking brightness.o. Note that each rule starts with a target name in the left margin, followed by a colon, and optionally followed by any dependencies. If there are one or more commands needed to build the target, they are listed below, with tabs starting each such line.

Of course, we then need a rule for being sure that brightness.o is up to date, and telling us how to build that:

brightness.o: brightness.c
    gcc -c brightness.c

So, what happens if we issue the command "make brightness"? Make starts by building a tree of dependencies. What do we need to build brightness? Answer: an up-to-date brightness.o. What do we need to build that? There's another rule that tells us, and so on. After building the whole tree of dependencies the system will decide that the first check to be made is whether brightness.c been changed since brightness.o was last built. and if so that code will be recompiled. Then, if the brightness exectuable is older than the (possibly recompiled) brightness.o, the executable is relinked. In short, only necessary work is done.

Note that, unlike a script, a makefile is not a list of steps to be performed in order; it's a set of rules, and each rule is considered as needed according to the circumstance. Rules are chosen by pattern matching on filenames and by checking whether any dependencies must be rebuilt. Once a rule is chosen, there may indeed be one or more steps (actually zero or more) specified to build the target.
Pattern rules and automatic variables

Make has many many other sophisticated features, but there's one more you should learn early. Consider this fragment:

# 
#    To get any .o, compile the corresponding .c
#
%.o:%.c 
    gcc $(FLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

Our first approach required a separate rule for each .o, but all of those rules look almost the same. The fragment above uses what make calls pattern rules (e.g. %.c) and automatic variables (e.g. $<). You'll have to read the GNU make documentation for all the details, but what the fragment above says is:

    Every .o file depends on the corresponding .c file
    The name of that .c file is substituted into the gcc command after the -c option

So, a single rule suffices to build a .o file from any corresponding .c file. Also shown in the gcc command line is the substitution of two variables FLAGS and CFLAGS that we can assume have been set with the compiler options that we're using on this project. We can thus ensure that the same compiler options are automatically applied to each compilation. Obviously we can (and should) do something similar on the commands that link the executables.
A realistic example

Appendix II contains a makefile that builds HW assignments 1. With the hints given above you should be able to figure out most of what it's doing.

Right now, the COMP 40 homework submission process expects a compile script not a makefile; you should be sure to provide a working compile script or else your homework may not be graded. Still it's good to know how makefiles work, and we may sometime soon switch to using them for some assignments.
Build scripts as documentation

Like any other code you write, your build scripts and makefiles should be designed as documentation to be read by other programmers. Especially if you use languages like make or mk, your build scripts formally document which pieces of your system depend on which others. Of course, your scripts also document the compiler switches and other settings used.

Make sure your build scripts are cleanly structured and easy to read. When it's not obvious from the code, include comments explaining what various build targets do, and any other information that might be needed by someone maintaining or modifying your code. Be especially careful to document non-obvious dependencies on tools or libraries, e.g.:

# This build runs against the grapics library 
# version 2.8, which is current as of July, 2013.  The 
# program depends on features such as double buffering
# introduced in v2.8.  
# NEEDSWORK We should add an automatic configuration 
# test to ensure double buffering is available.

APPENDIX I: A COMP 40 Compile Script

This is the compile script for a recent version of COMP 40 HW 1. That assignment requires the development of two executables, named brightness and fgroups

APPENDIX II: A COMP 40 Makefile

The following makefile is more or less equivalent to the compile script shown above in Appendex I. Like that script, this makefile defaults to building the brightness and fgroups executables. So, if we assume this file is called Makefile, here are some commands we could issue:

make all          # builds fgroups and brightness and any needed .o files
make              # same as "make all" because all is the default target
make brightness   # builds brightness, and any .o files that needs
make fgroups.o    # recompiles fgroups.o only if fgroups.c is changed
make clean        # remove all .o files and executables fgroups and brightness

Here is the sample makefile:

#            Makefile for COMP 40 Homework 1
#
#     Author: Noah Mendelsohn (adapted from Norman Ramsey's compile script)
#
#  Maintenance targets:
#
#
#    all         - (default target) make sure everything's compiled
#    clean       - clean out all compiled object and executable files
#    brightness  - compile just the brightness program
#    fgroups     - compile just the fingerprint group program.
#
#

# Executables to built using "make all"

EXECUTABLES = brightness fgroups

#
#  The following is a compromise. You MUST list all your .h files here.
#  If any .h file changes, all .c files will be recompiled. To do better,
#  we could make an explicit target for each .o, naming only the .h
#  files it really uses.
#
# Add your own .h files to the right side of the assingment below.

INCLUDES = 

# Do all C compies with gcc (at home you could try clang)
GCC = gcc

# Comp 40 directory

COMP40 = /comp/40

# the next two lines enable you to compile and link against CII40
CIIFLAGS = `pkg-config --cflags cii40`
CIILIBS = `pkg-config --libs cii40`

# the next three lines enable you to compile and link against course software
CFLAGS = -I. -I$(COMP40)/include $(CIIFLAGS)
LIBS = $(CIILIBS) -lm    
LFLAGS = -L$(COMP40)/lib64

# these flags max out warnings and debug info
FLAGS = -g -O -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -std=c99 -pedantic

# 
#    'make all' will build all executables
#
#    Note that "all" is the default target that make will build
#    if nothing is specifically requested
#
all: $(EXECUTABLES)

# 
#    'make clean' will remove all object and executable files
#
clean:
    rm -f $(EXECUTABLES) *.o


# 
#    To get any .o, compile the corresponding .c
#
%.o:%.c $(INCLUDES)
    $(GCC) $(FLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

#
# Individual executables
#
#    Each executable depends on one or more .o files.
#    Those .o files are linked together to build the corresponding
#    executable.
#
brightness: brightness.o
    $(GCC) $(FLAGS) $(LFLAGS) -o brightness brightness.o -lpnmrdr $(LIBS)

fgroups: fgroups.o
    $(GCC) $(FLAGS) $(LFLAGS) -o fgroups  fgroups.o $(LIBS)

echo:
    echo "$(CIIFLAGS)"

Everyone Loses if Britain Exits the E.U.

The prospect of a British exit from the European Union has been around for a long time. Britain never fully warmed to the idea of the European Union, and the “euroskeptics” clamoring to get out give the impression that nothing the union could offer would sway them.

A referendum on British membership has been promised by Prime Minister David Cameron and will go before British voters as early as June. A vote to withdraw, or a “Brexit,” would deal a serious blow to a European Union already battered by an economic crisis and an immigration crisis. With all that in mind, the European Council president, Donald Tusk, released a proposal on Tuesday to modify Britain’s obligations to the bloc that he says goes “really far in addressing all the concerns raised by Prime Minister Cameron.”

Mr. Tusk’s plan would create a special mechanism to protect non-euro members — Britain never adopted the euro and proudly uses its own currency — from any unfair advantage eurozone countries may have. It would allow Britain to reduce welfare payments to non-British European citizens living in Britain. It would formally recognize the “opt-out” clause that allows Britain to reject some European Union measures, such as taking in a set quota of refugees. And it would acknowledge Britain’s right to sovereignty.

Britain benefits enormously from membership in the union’s common market and, as a member, it is also able to influence European policies. It would lose on both counts if it were to withdraw, and that would affect Britain’s ties to NATO and to the United States. The Tusk proposal gives Britain leeway to distance itself from policies it finds onerous. As Mr. Cameron accurately argues, Britain would then have the “best of both worlds.”

Now he must make that case to Britain’s skeptics, which will not be easy in a nation worried about the sanctity and safety of its borders. The tide of refugees from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa willing to brave the weather, stormy seas and closed borders grows larger by the day. More than 67,000 refugees have arrived in Europe by sea since the start of this year. The newcomers join more than one million people who sought refuge in Europe last year, adding new strains to already depressed economies. This has been of serious concern in Britain. But if it pulls out of the union, it will have no more say on European migration policies and no right to help in policing the tunnel entrance in Calais, France, where thousands of migrants trying to reach its shores have massed.

Mr. Tusk’s job now is to persuade the other 27 members of the union to accept the concessions to Britain; his proposal is being debated in the European Parliament ahead of the European Summit meeting in Brussels on Feb. 18 and 19. One controversial point is the provision allowing Britain to curb social benefits for European workers in Britain. But not to compromise, Mr. Tusk warns, “would be compromising our common future.” And that would be a tragedy for Britain, other European nations, and for a world that needs a united and prosperous Europe.

Beneath the surface of the global financial system lurks a multitrillion-dollar problem that could sap the strength of large economies for years to come.

The problem is the giant, stagnant pool of loans that companies and people around the world are struggling to pay back. Bad debts have been a drag on economic activity ever since the financial crisis of 2008, but in recent months, the threat posed by an overhang of bad loans appears to be rising. China is the biggest source of worry. Some analysts estimate that China’s troubled credit could exceed $5 trillion, a staggering number that is equivalent to half the size of the country’s annual economic output.

Official figures show that Chinese banks pulled back on their lending in December. If such trends persist, China’s economy, the second-largest in the world behind the United States’, may then slow even more than it has, further harming the many countries that have for years relied on China for their growth.

But it’s not just China. Wherever governments and central banks unleashed aggressive stimulus policies in recent years, a toxic debt hangover has followed. In the United States, it took many months for mortgage defaults to fall after the most recent housing bust — and energy companies are struggling to pay off the cheap money that they borrowed to pile into the shale boom.

Why China Is Rattling the World

China’s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.

In Europe, analysts say bad loans total more than $1 trillion. Many large European banks are still burdened with defaulted loans, complicating policy makers’ efforts to revive the Continent’s economy. Italy, for instance, announced a plan last week to clean out bad loans from its plodding banking industry.

Elsewhere, bad loans are on the rise at Brazil’s biggest banks, as the country grapples with the effects of an enormous credit binge.

“If you have a boom and then a bust, you create economic losses,” said Alberto Gallo, head of global macro credit research at the Royal Bank of Scotland in London. “You can hope the losses one day turn into profits, but if they don’t, they are a drag on the economy.”

In good times, companies and people take on new loans, often at low interest rates, to buy goods and services. When economies slow, these debts become difficult to pay for many borrowers. And the bigger the boom, the more soured debt that is left behind for bankers and policy makers to deal with.

    Op-Ed Columnist: When China StumblesJAN. 8, 2016

In theory, it makes sense for banks to swiftly recognize the losses embedded in bad loans — and then make up for those losses by raising fresh capital. The cleaned-up banks are more likely to start lending again — and thus play their part in fueling the recovery.

But in reality, this approach can be difficult to carry out. Recognizing losses on bad loans can mean pushing corporate borrowers into bankruptcy and households into foreclosure. Such disruption can send a chill through the economy, require unpopular taxpayer bailouts and have painful social consequences. And in some cases, the banks might find it extremely difficult to raise fresh capital in the markets.

Continue reading the main story

Even so, the drawback of delaying the cleanup is that the banks remain wounded and reluctant to lend, damping any recovery that takes place. Japan, economists say, waited far too long after its credit boom of the 1980s to force its banks to recognize huge losses — and the economy suffered for years after as a result.

Now many banking experts are beginning to worry about China’s bad loans.

Fears that the country’s economy is slowing have weighed heavily on global markets in recent months because a weak China can drag down growth globally.

Many of these concerns focus on China’s banking industry. In recent years, banks and other financial companies in China issued a tidal wave of new loans and other credit products, many of which will not be paid back in full.

China’s financial sector will have loans and other financial assets of $30 trillion at the end of this year, up from $9 trillion seven years ago, said Charlene Chu, an analyst in Hong Kong for Autonomous Research.

“The world has never seen credit growth of this magnitude over a such short time,” she said in an email. “We believe it has directly or indirectly impacted nearly every asset price in the world, which is why the market is so jittery about the idea that credit problems in China could unravel.”

Headline figures for bad loans in China most likely do not capture the size of the problem, analysts say. In her analysis, Ms. Chu estimates that at the end of 2016, as much as 22 percent of the Chinese financial system’s loans and assets will be “nonperforming,” a banking industry term used to describe when a borrower has fallen behind on payments or is stressed in ways that make full repayment unlikely. In dollar terms, that works out to $6.6 trillion of troubled loans and assets.

“This estimate really isn’t that unreasonable,” Ms. Chu said in the email. “We’ve seen similar ratios in other countries. What’s different is the scale, which reflects the massive size of China’s credit boom.” She estimates that the bad loans could lead to $4.4 trillion of actual losses.

Although there is not enough official data to come up with a precise figure for bad loans, other analysts have come up with estimates of around $5 trillion.

Given the murkiness of the Chinese financial industry, other analysts arrive at estimates for a “baseline” figure for bad loans. Christopher Balding, an associate professor at the HSBC School of Business at Peking University, said that an analysis of corporations’ interest payments to Chinese banks suggested that 8 percent of loans to companies might be troubled. But Mr. Balding said it was possible that the bad loan number for China’s overall financial system could be higher.

The looming question for the global economy, however, is how China might deal with a vast pool of bad debts.

After a previous credit boom in the 1990s, the Chinese government provided financial support to help clean up the country’s banks. But the cost of similar interventions today could be dauntingly high given the size of the latest credit boom. And more immediately, rising bad debts could crimp lending to strong companies, undermining economic growth in the process.

“My sense is that the Chinese policy makers seem like a deer in the headlights,” Mr. Balding said. “They really don’t know what to do.”

In Europe, for instance, some countries have taken years to come to grips with their banks’ bad loans.

In some cases, the delay arose from a reluctance, at least in part, to force people out of their homes. Even though Ireland’s biggest banks suffered huge losses after the financial crisis, they held back from forcing many borrowers who had defaulted out of their homes. In recent years, the Irish government has pursued a widespread plan that aims to reduce the debt load of financially stressed homeowners. Such forbearance appears not to have weakened the Irish economy, which has recovered at a faster rate than those of other European countries.

Still, the perils of waiting too long are evident in Italy, which in January announced a proposal to help banks sell their bad loans. Some critics of the plan say it resembles a government bailout of the banks, while other skeptics say the banks might not use it because it appears to be too expensive.

“The big problem in the Italian system is that they acted very late,” said Silvia Merler, an affiliate fellow at Bruegel, a European research firm that focuses on economic issues. “They could have done something smarter — and they could have done it earlier.”

MANCHESTER, N.H. — In the crowded New Hampshire primary, no candidate may shape the direction of the Republican presidential campaign more than the man who finished sixth in Iowa: Jeb Bush.

With Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Donald J. Trump and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida each finishing more than 20 percentage points higher than Mr. Bush in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, the former Florida governor is facing growing pressure to either demonstrate his appeal to voters or leave the race.

Specifically, many Republicans — including some of his supporters and donors — said that Mr. Bush must finish ahead of Mr. Rubio in the primary here next Tuesday to justify continuing his campaign into South Carolina.

“If Rubio beats him badly in New Hampshire, Jeb is toast,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, a Bush backer who spent most of Tuesday traveling the state with him. Mr. Graham added that Mr. Bush must either “tie Rubio or beat him” in this state.

The burden falls so heavily on Mr. Bush, who won just 2.8 percent of the vote in Iowa, because of Republican anxieties about the top two finishers there, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump: Many party leaders fear that the nomination of Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz would lead to an electoral rout this fall.

Snapshots From New Hampshire

The days between the nation’s first and second presidential nominating contest are intense – and often emotional, for voters and candidates alike.

Were Mr. Bush to keep campaigning into South Carolina, he could create a split among pragmatic-minded voters, denying Mr. Rubio the chance to consolidate this bloc of Republicans — and strengthening the hands of Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump. Many Republicans believe that if Mr. Rubio, who won an unexpected 23 percent in Iowa, right behind Mr. Trump’s 24 percent, again delivers a strong performance in New Hampshire, he will have earned the right to carry the banner for the party establishment.

Asked Tuesday evening by reporters how well he felt he needed to do in New Hampshire to justify staying in the race, Mr. Bush struck a defiant note.

“Oh, I’m continuing on,” he said. “I’m continuing on, yeah.”

Two rivals, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, are appealing to the same voters and also need a strong showing in New Hampshire. But Mr. Bush is far better financed and organized and can most likely stay in the race longer than they can otherwise.

While Mr. Bush had $7.6 million in the bank and the “super PAC” supporting him had an additional $58.6 million as of Jan. 1, Mr. Kasich had just $2.5 million and Mr. Christie a paltry $1.1 million. And neither Mr. Christie nor Mr. Kasich, both of whom have spent the vast majority of their time in New Hampshire, has much in the way of organization in South Carolina.

Mr. Bush, by contrast, has an active network of supporters there and has tapped into Mr. Graham’s organization. And perhaps most important, the super PAC supporting Mr. Bush has shown a willingness, to put it mildly, to spend millions of dollars against his rivals, particularly Mr. Rubio, whom it has spent more than $20 million attacking.

The prospect of the super PAC maintaining its assault on Mr. Rubio after the New Hampshire primary leaves many Republicans uneasy about Mr. Bush’s intentions. And Mr. Rubio’s supporters, cognizant of these concerns, began moving on Tuesday to stoke these fears.

“If Jeb doesn’t do well there, and he’s still got millions and millions to spend, does he stay around?” mused Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, a Rubio backer. “Who knows.”

But, Mr. Gardner noted, “more money has been spent attacking Republicans by fellow Republicans in this election than any cycle in the history of the party.”

It is not just supporters of Mr. Rubio who are dismayed. Some of Mr. Bush’s major donors, including those with long ties to the family, are also growing impatient, hoping he will not go past New Hampshire absent a strong finish here.

Graphic: Which States Cruz, Trump and Rubio Need to Win

Few are willing to say so publicly, and on a Tuesday conference call the campaign held for fund-raisers, they did not even get a chance to say so privately: The Bush aides running the call did not open it up to questions.

It is unclear what threshold Mr. Bush might feel he must reach to continue after the New Hampshire vote. But on the conference call and in talking points the campaign emailed late Monday night to supporters, Mr. Bush’s team pointed to surveys showing him in a statistical tie for second in New Hampshire.

The campaign also built up Mr. Bush’s effort to win the state, and trumpeted New Hampshire’s recent role in determining the Republican standard-bearer. (Left unmentioned was the 2000 primary here, in which Mr. Bush’s older brother, George W., lost in a landslide and still went on to claim the nomination.)

“The Granite State has long been the state voters look to in choosing the nominee and next president,” the staff wrote in the email to supporters, highlighting Mr. Bush’s endorsements and organizational strength.

In reality, Mr. Bush’s top advisers know Mr. Rubio’s finish in Iowa makes it harder for Mr. Bush to claim that he is the logical alternative to Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz. Yet he seems torn between focusing his fire on Mr. Rubio or Mr. Trump.

On Tuesday, his campaign began airing an unusually long two-minute ad in New Hampshire attacking Mr. Trump for insulting veterans, women and the disabled. And at a stop in Henniker, N.H., Mr. Bush aimed some of his most pointed language yet at Mr. Trump, who finished second in Iowa, calling him a “loser” with “deep insecurities.”

Yet on the same day Mr. Bush went so aggressively after Mr. Trump, he also sought to raise doubts about Mr. Rubio, incorporating Mr. Cruz for purposes of comparison.

“If you look at their records, they’re gifted in how they speak, but what about their life experience?” Mr. Bush said at Franklin Pierce University in Rindge, likening the two to President Obama, who was elected president after less than four years in the Senate. “Is there something in their past that would suggest they have the capability of making a tough decision?”

Yet there are signs Mr. Bush may still have some work to do.Speaking at the Hanover Inn near the Vermont border on Tuesday, Mr. Bush finished a fiery riff about protecting the country — “I won’t be out here blow-harding, talking a big game without backing it up,” he said — and was met with total silence.

“Please clap,” he said, sounding defeated.

The crowd laughed — and then, finally, clapped.

Anthony Joshua ready and waiting for Joseph Parker.

Kiwi heavyweight boxer Joseph Parker is a top-ranked world title contender for the first time.

The 24-year-old South Aucklander's trainer Kevin Barry tweeted on Friday afternoon that his young charge was now rated No 1 with the WBO.

"As of today Joseph Parker is now ranked #1 with the WBO #TEAMPARKER," Barry said to his 5,700 followers.

Parker, who went to 18-0 as a professional with a eighth-round technical knockout of American southpaw Jason Bergman in Samoa earlier this month, has leapfrogged English prospect Anthony Joshua and former longtime champion Wladimir Klitschko of the Ukraine into top spot.

ROBYN EDIE

Joseph Parker is now the No 1 ranked heavyweight contender with the WBO.

The rising Kiwi's climb may be the first solid step towards a fight many boxing fans have been eager to see for some time now.

It is understood Parker does not automatically become the mandatory challenger to British belt holder Tyson Fury and would have to fight No 2 contender Joshua to determine who claims the right for a shot at the title.

Heavyweight division gold medallist at the 2012 London Olympics, 26-year-old Joshua's record stands at 15-0.

Dean Lonergan of Duco Events, Parker's promoters, recently said Joshua was running scared of a fight with Parker and Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn replied that the Kiwi would have to get in line.
Ad Feedback

But a video emerged earlier this week of Joshua saying if Parker wanted to fight him, "he can come fight me".

"I've known about Parker since probably about 2009, when I was coming up in the amateurs," Joshua told iFL TV.

"Styles make fights, doesn't it? He's knocking out guys over in New Zealand, I'm knocking out guys in the UK - we come together and someone's going to get knocked out. That's just heavy-handed, fast, young prospects coming through the division."

Parker's next fight will be in Christchurch in late April, but an opponent is yet to be confirmed.

Controverisal Englishman Fury also holds the WBA belt after defeating Klitschko in November last year. The pair have signed for a rematch, but a date for the bout has not been finalised.

The two other champions in the division alongside Fury are Americans Deontay Wilder (WBC) and Charles Martin (IBF).

Parker is also ranked seventh with the WBC and IBF and 11th with the WBA.

All which is a downer in my situation is the females certainly not Communicate with one. As expected, because so many are and also the and don't speak out English language, that may be easy to undestand, however, with all the women who Will be able to speak out plus talk with The english language, it could be pleasant to listen for these talk to one another rather, particularly on the beginnings on the scenes.,

Hello, everyone! This is one of the weirdest sites: or your money back! We have ZIM, neopets, music, and much, much, more. E-mail us for questions, comments, complaints and information. Why not click on the Very Weird Stuff link to see more, or click on the music link? We have halloween and christmas pictures on the NeoPics link. Cheese is not a wild thing!!!!!!!!! Now I have decided to go for a world record. I will try to make the longest web page ever, made completely out of text! Won't that be fun? I will just type, and type, and never, ever use copy and paste. Wow...I really must be bored. Just goes to show what boredom can do to you. Any way, that's it for now. Wait, no it isn't, I still have to keep going, and going, and going. Because I do. THE REST OF THE STUFF I TYPE WILL BE COMPLETLY IN CAPS JUST BECAUSE I CAN. THAT IS ALL. SEEYA! Hi, I'm back. So far this is nowhere near the world record. I think. I don't exactly know where it is...oh, well. I'll just have to do the very best that I can. No one is really coming here, anyway. So it doesn't matter. By the way, TAB is a worthwhile, community-service organization. The form link is to a 100% fake TAB registration form that you can fill out just for laughs. I can't believe I'm bothering to do this. I have very low expectations of my site. None ever comes here, I could do this all day long and I still wouldn't have any more hits. This is just a pointless excursive in spelling errors and grammatical imprecision. May your day be shiney! The following is an extremely weird poem-thingy that I wrote when I was in a relatively weird mood:
never mind that noise my dear can anyone pass the cheese only if you say pretty please oh, boy do I have to sneeze. why must everyone always rhyme, why I’m a poet and don’t I know it? what I fear comes right after here not this life or the next will I ever be able to pass the test? we’re stuck in here, (alone my dear) and we’ll problem never get out so don’t start to shout. it’s dark and I want to go home is where the heart was where is it now? we’ll never know but oh crap it’s starting to snow and it’s time to show and tell about the well that you found last summer at camp when it was damp it was near the ramp oh god why must this be I liked that tree but now it’s gone, farewell so long I’ll miss you as long as you write but then I’m afraid to say good-night. my dear there’s nothing to fear that’s only a box that’s made of blocks next to the wagon that looks like a dragon why are you shaking it’s your fear that is making you shiver and act all a quiver. don’t you know that you only need be afraid of fear and never anything here and certainly not a post that acts like a ghost?
See, very weird. At least it fills up my word quota for the day. Not that I exactly have a word quota for the day. It just sounded very professional to say it. Anyway, I still don't think that anyone is actually coming here. You'd have to be an absolute loser (or really bored) to come here. I'd probley come here, but that isn't much of a surprise. After all, I've been to the Really Really Big Button That Doesn't Do Anything website over 50 times. Pathetic. But, whatever. As long as I'm happy, right. Humor the crazy person, okay? Oh, guess what? According to someone you problem don't know, this is the second most pointless website ever! Next to the Really Big Button, of course. I feel special. Come on everyone, group hug. Okay, now I'm starting to scare myself...I'm gonna quit for today. Seeya. Now I'm back. Is this getting confusing to you? Too bad. Now I want you to go to http://quiz.ravenblack.net/blood.pl?biter=eon" If you do this I'll get points in the game. Come on all you non-existing people! Help me! You know you want to! It's a worthy cause! Honestly, the more time I waste playing the game, the less time I'll work on this site and the less stuff you gotta read. Although why you'd be here if you didn't want to read is beyond me. Maybe you're lost. Okay, if you want to get out, click the little refresh button, okay? Good...what? You say it didn't let you out? Oh, well. You must be caught in a time warp. Keep pressing it. Maybe you'll break free. What's that. The little counter at the bottom keeps going up? Never mind. That's just how many times you have to click before you can leave. Good-bye.

Hey, I'm once again: back. I don't suppose you fell for that little thing about the refresh button. After all, you're a responsible, intelligent person who apparently has a lot of time on your hands. Well, you can't possibly have more time than I do. I mean, after all, I made this site. You're only browsing it. And most people don't even come here. Not even my friends...*sniffle* The just ignore this poor, pathetic little page. All they do is fill out the TAB form and leave. I think. Maybe they're here right now! HI! HOW ARE YOU DOING? I'M FINE! THANKS FOR COMING! YES, I'M YELLING! Who am I kidding. This page won't get a single hit, unless I bribe people...now that has possibilities. Okay, fill out the TAB form, so I have proof that you bothered to come here and...uh...I'll...uh...send you a sandwich? Please allow 6-8 weeks for delivery. I'm bored. I'm gonna go hug a moose. MOOSE! I love-d you moose! Hey, I'm back again! Yea...*waits for applause* okay! Now I want all you loyal fans...*cricket chirps* to go to the link to see what I'm like. I took a whole bunch of personality quizzes and posted them there. I'm an evil villain, kitty and a freakazoid so far. And I only took the quiz once, too. Spooky how accurate they are...anyway, I command you to go! I'm going. I'm back. I'm gonna start counting how many times I say back. Let's see: 1...2...3...4...5! Wow. I must really be desperate for something to do. I now officially have proof that someone has been here! It was one of my friends. Apparently this page really is getting long, because my friend said something to that effect. Maybe. Anyway, moving on! I'm just basically typing nothing. Just like all those reports people have to do. You know? With a specific number of words. They start out with half that number, and then just fill in words until they have the right amount. I salute those people. You're great tradition is being carried out here, on the second most pointless site ever! Well. Maybe eventually some weird, bored person will wander onto my site on accident and be mildly entertained be my site until they wander onto a live video feed of a coffee maker. Or maybe not. I only know that I'm entertaining me, which was my original goal. So. I've done what I've set out to accomplish. Yea, me! I'm so special. You see, most people, they don't like reading or writing. So if you're not most people, you've made it down this far without skipping, skimming or getting the spark notes version. (Which I think does not exist) My point is, if you've bothered to read this, then, (like me) you probley have also read the ketchup bottle so many times that you have it down verbatim. Look verbatim up. It's a word. But, you should know that, since you like reading. Or maybe you're just skimming. Anyway, there's nothing wrong with reading food labels. You might be asked a question about them on a quiz show. And now, for the million-dollar question: How many calories are there in a single serving of Mustard? I can just see it now...It could be called Know-Your-Food. Or You are What you Eat. It'd probley be as popular as those game shows that no one's ever heard of. Speaking of food, what's up with pie? There's strawberry pie, apple, pumpkin and so many others, but there is no grape pie! I know. I'm just as upset about this unfortunate lack of development in the pie division. Think about it. Grapes are used to make jelly, jam, juice and raisins. What makes them undesirable for pie? Would they dry into raisins? Couldn't you just stick some jelly in a piecrust and bake it? It just doesn't make any sense. Another thing that bothers me is organ grinders. You know, the foreign guys with the bellhop hats and the little music thingy and the cute little monkey with the bellhop hat who collects the money? Okay. They're basically begging on the street. How did they ever afford an organ-thingy? Wouldn't it make more sense to get a kazoo, if you're broke? And if they're so poor, what possessed them to buy a monkey? I mean, I don't think I could afford a monkey, and I'm not exactly on the streets. Obviously I at least have a computer...so, back to the organ grinders. I would have sold the monkey and the organ and been able to eat for at least a year. Or, if I was weirder than I am, I could at least kill the monkey with the organ and eat it. Why on earth did they keep the monkey? It must have cost a fortune to feed...not to mention the mess. That's just one of those many facts of life that are better left mysteries. Especially since no one but me would ask the question. I better go. I think I hear a monkey...Okay...now I'm back. That's the sixth time I've said back! I realize that this longest text ever must be very boring and not worth anyone's time. But I'd like to take this time to thank the 2 and 1/2 people in the entire universe who have bothered to read this entire thing. I'm not exactly sure who they are, but: thanks! Right now, my spacebar is malfunctioning...that's not good...I have to press it two or three times just to insert a freaking space. Maybe the evil little faeries with the sharp little teeth have put their evil faerie dust on my computer. Or maybe not. This is too frustrating. Goodbye for now...Now I'm back. And still frustrated. But for a different reason. Today I had the misfortune of playing a Treasure Planet game on neopets.com It was terrible. Apparently the point of the game was to get your character to shout "Whoo-Hoo!" as many times as possible before you splattered your brains on the rocks, all the while listening to a soundtrack that is similar to a dying ceiling fan. Of course, when I started out I accidentally hit the rocks approximately three million times. Halfway though I used my four remaining brain-cells to decide that the game was dumb. So my goal changed from surviving to laughing evilly while my character died. So the game naturally did everything it could to preserve my life. The stupid game is still going on and I refuse to quit because I want my points. My character is actually dodging the stupid rocks better now then when I controlled him. I hate irony. Seeya. Okay. Now I'm back again. Today I added an update page, which is basically a less chaotic, outlined version of this without all the ranting. It's more like techno talk about arrays and how much I suck and whether or not the Braves will win this year. Okay, the whole braves thing is made up. But everything else I've said so far is true. I think. Maybe I should start on a boring disclaimer...Eh-hem. All contents of this site were designed for entertainment purposes only. Any use thereof that is not stated in the above mentioned statement would make the author, hereby referred to as Patron Saint of Paper Clips, very angry. Should you violate the purpose of this site: i.e. become not entertained, the Patron Saint of Paper Clips will be forced to take drastic measures. This is specified in Code: 343 of the Flaming Chicken Handbook. Ooooo…that’s a great idea! I’m gonna start quoting from the Flaming Chicken Handbook! Code: 343 of the Flaming Chicken Handbook states that the Patron Saint of Paper Clips (that’s me) is allowed to cause vague, pain like sensations while the offending person (or alien life form, dog, etc.) isn’t paying attention. Now I have a purpose in life! To make up quotes from the non-existent Flaming Chicken Handbook, which I’m sure you have a copy of. No? Too bad. It’s in the mail, I promise! Now I must take my leave…and remember. Cheese is watching. Okay...I'm back...I think that eventually half of this thing will consist of the word back over and over again...that's just weird. Which fits the motif of the rest of the site. There's even a money back guarantee. Isn’t' that nice? See? Now no one can ever say that I don't take care of my viewers. Especially since I don't have viewers. I have readers. Wait...I really don't even know if anyone bothers to read this. Even if I put it in a less chaotic, more user-friendly format people would still ignore this because it involves: reading. Yes. Sad to admit, but the majority of people would rather read the summary at the back of a book rather than the whole book itself. What has the world come to? It's pathetic. Especially since I'm bothering to write all this. It's not fair! Why can't I have more readers?! All the other internet writers have nothing on me, except they're better at advertising, having a central theme/plot and basically more talented. Whereas I'm more into the whole ranting and raving stage right now. Plus, I am horrible at spelling. Which is bad. Thank the powers that be for spell-check. The single greatest invention of the computer gods. I'm getting bored, so I think I'm done for the day. May your day be shiney! I'm back again! And I feel weird! I found at that yet another one of my friends is reading this. Creepy. Just how much time do they have on their hands. Perhaps their just trying to be nice. I can just see it now...an organization devoted not to feeding the hungry, or peace, or love or whatever, but to giving recognition to all those poor, pathetic, unpopular websites. I wonder what it's name would be. Don't Ignore Sites? Would it be called DIS? Isn't that like a slang term for an insult? Would that be considered poetic justice, or just a nice coincidence? And why do I even care? I'll tell you why. Because I have nothing else to do right now. I could be playing neopets, but ever since my bad experience with Treasure Planet, I don't feel like it. Oh, by the way, I noticed that whenever I use spell-check, my stupid computer turns the word probley into to word problem. To prevent this, I did nothing. So, it is now up to you, the imaginary reader, to decide whether I mean probley or problem...it's almost like a game! But without the bad sound track. And I promise not to force you to live when you would rather die. Moving on, I have nothing else to say, but don't feel like quitting just yet. I'm like the little engine that could. Or maybe the Energizer Bunny. I just keep going, and going and going. Or I could be like that annoying guy on T.V. who keeps asking if you can hear him. If my site manages to last a decade, my readers *snicker* will probley wonder what I'm talking about. My answer is simple. It doesn't matter. I'm just rambling. Which means that it doesn't matter if you understand anything I say. Doesn't that make you feel better? I bet it does. Wow. Look how long this has gotten. I even impress myself. Who would have thought I have this much free time? And I congratulate any reader who has gotten this far. Ooooooo! You must check out the fortunes section of the random stuff page! I've just gotten an idea for some more, original, fortunes...I gotta go!(may the moose be with you) And now I am back. I swear. If iI fill out the fake tab form I'm gonna have to put back as my favorite word...I already have filled it out, though. Would it be cheating to fill it out again? Only if I had multiple personalities. Or would it be cheating if I didn't have multiple personalities? The world may never know. Just like how many licks it takes to get to the bottom of a tootsie pop. Would it vary? The number of licks, I mean. Someone could have super-disolving spit, or watery-spit. Or what if you took big ol' slobbery licks? Does the commercial take that into account? No. It doesn't. And let me tell you, it's an outrage. It deludes all of American's sweet, innocent, candy-loving children into thinking that a cartoon owl is smarter than they are! "Mr. Owl, can you tell us how many licks does it take to get to the bottom of a tootsie pop?" Or whatever. And "Mr. Owl" replies "One...Twoo...Three! Chomp" And he bites it. That teaches our youth that it's okay to agree to help someone, and then ruin their experiment. Well...it's not. I am going to start a protest group. Teens Against Cartoon Owls. We could call ourselves TACO! I love the little tacos, I love them good! That is a direct quote from GIR, co-star and comic-relief on INVADER ZIM. Hmmmm...intersting. I put hyphens in both of his titles...it must be a conspiracy! I gotta go. Those TACO buttons don't make themselves, you know. I'm back again. And not so cheesed off about the whole tootsie roll pop thing. Right now, I have another twenty minutes on the Internet before I'm gonna watch T.V. And I can't think of anything else to do. So, predictably, here I am. It's not like I have anything better to do. Obviously, you know this. After all, look how long this text is. I wonder if I've made the world record? If I did, would I stop this? Why bother asking? I'll will most likely still be adding to this on my death bed. Hmmmmm...has any old, senile person ever written anything? Was it coherent? Did it make more sense that this text? Is it possible to make less sense? Am I enjoying asking retorical questions? Yes. Yes, I am. But I seriously wonder what something written by a senile person would be like. I've heard of poems and stuff written by people who were high, insane or paranoid. But never senile. Can a senile person write? Aren't they regressed to a child-like state? Does it even matter? Is anyone even reading this? Did I resume asking retorical questions? Do you care? Is this eating up time? I feel like I'm playing questions only on whose line is it anway. I probley should have capitalized something, or underlined but I'm feeling lazy...hey, you try to keep your two and a half readers happy! It's really stressfull. Someday, I'm gonna snap and just delete this entire thing. Gee, I hope not! I worked sorta hard on this. It's great for making random topics weave together to form an overall infrastructure of chaos. That made little sense. That's why it's here, and not some critically acclaimed site. Ooooooooooooo! I'm gonna quote from the FLAMING CHICKENS HANDBOOK again! Yep! I bet you were just breathless in anticipation. Okay. Here goes. Code: 472 of the Flaming Chickens Handbook states that this site in no way aknowledges the existance of other, better sites (hereon reffered to as the Losers) The Losers are a myth. The Patron Saint of Paper Clips (me again!) claims no knowledge as to where that particullary nasty rumor started, but confirms that this is the best site ever. It would be a sin against humanity for a better site to exist. Should you refuse to aknowledge the Patron Saint of Paper Clips as the ruler of the Internet, you will be subjected to punishment as stated in Code 343 of the Flaming Chicken Handbook (i.e. Experience vague, pain-like sensations when you're not paying attention) This has been a public service announcement. This is a test, I repeat only a test. Had this been an actual emergency, we would have bought up all the can openers and charged 3 cows and a pig for each one. I repeat, lock all you doors and windows, this is it. I repeat, there is nothing to worry about. Everything is fine. The end is not here. I'm going, you're on you're own! Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm back!*smiles brightly* And apparantly delusional! Anyway, I just finished rereading my longest text ever. And I became inspired to talk about nothing. You see, I periodically read the longest text ever to check the constant downward spiral of my sanity. Hmmm...I seem to be entertaining myself though, even while reading what I wrote. Which is why I still go to the Really Really Big Button That Doesn't Do Anything website. Because I am easily amused and have lots and lots of time on my hands. Maybe, some day far in the future (like next Thursday) I'll print a copy of this insane text. And then go door to door distributing it. Eventually, this would become a monthly tradition. Whole families would gather around their front door, in breathless anticipation while they attempted to barracade me out. I can just see the whole community rising to thwart my attempts to spread love, joy and insane chaos. I probley wouldn't actually print this out (think how much paper it would take!) but if I do, only friends and enemies will receive copies. Hmmmm...maybe my condition is worsening. Or not. I'm still peeved about the cartoon owl from the Tootsie Roll Pop commercials. He is pure evil. TACO will eventually destroy him. Unless he has already been destroyed by an even more radical Anti-Cartoon-Owl group. I hope not. Or, would that be good? I suppose I could let someone else have the glory. After all, I'm not in this line of buisness for the fame, fortune and power. What line of buisness, do you ask? Why, the assasinating annoying cartoon characters buisness. (Actually I just question them untill they spontaneously combust, I ask lots of questions) So, in conclusion, ladies and gentleman of the jury(that's you) I could not have possibly tortured "Mr. Owl" to death. I love owls. Hmm...I seem to be jumping from one subject to another more frequently. Either I am growing more comfortable with my on-line writing, or I am progressivly getting more insane and chaotic. I also am psyco-analyzing myself a lot today...hmmmm...I'm even saying "hmmmmm..." a lot. Just like a real psychologist. Hmmmmmmm. Time for another boring disclaimer!!!!!!! Code: 742 of the Flaming Chickens Handbook states that in no part does the Patron Saint of Paper Clips (That's still me!) actually claim to be mentally ill. That's either a) a publicity stunt b) An attempt at humor c) a cry for help or d) none of the above You can e-mail your responses by conducting a scavenger hunt of this site. Some of the pages of this site contain a link encouging the two and a half people to e-mail the Patron Saint of Paper Clips. There may also be evil little links that are designed to confuse you. These links send stuff to someone named johnjones333@hotmail.com The Patron Saint of Paper Clips does not know who this individual is, but sincerly wishes that you send all your hate mail to him. Not that the aformentioned individual claims to have received hate mail (or mail of any kind) via a website link. Thank-you for your time. Remember to send your answers to my sanity quiz to the e-mail account, flamingchickens333@hotmail.com Oh, and once I refer to myself in the first person again, the handbook quote is over. I just thought that I might like to mention that. Oh. You're still here. I figured you rush right on over to e-mail me. Perhaps you don't have time to waste e-mailing me. HA! HA! HA! That's funny!!!! If you you don't have time to waste, what are you doing here?!!! Oh, who am I kidding. I figure that even the people I manage to lure onto my site from neopets don't even bother to come to this particular page. Maybe I should make the link come here directly...Hey! What a good idea! That way I can spread my love, joy and insane chaos to more people! I'm a genius. Gotta go, must lure innocent victems to the second most pointless site ever!!!! I'm back. And really angry, and confused. I've always known that I was weird, that's always been a given. But now I realize that I am considerably more normal than the rest of my family. Today we had a "family outing." Now, most families will go bowling, or putt-putt golfing. They may go to a resteraunt with an arcarde, or the movies or to a theme park. Not my family! No, we got the greatest family outing of all. We got to go to a bar and play pool!!!!!*waits for readers to become insanely jealous* Yep, that's right, a bar with a pool table! Not only did we get world class cuisine (under-cooked hotdogs and over-cooked hamburgers), my little sister (age 10) got taught pool by someone I strongly supect is an ex-convict! Naturally when it was announced that we'd be eating dinner in this place, I could hardly contain my excitment(I glared at my mother and asked why we couldn't go to Pizza Hut) When we arrived, we were promptly served (after thirty minutes) In the meantime, we played a family game of pool(my parents played while my brother and sister and I watched) After two rousing rounds, our food came. The food was superb, (our food came the exact opposite of how we ordered it, and half of the onion rings were missing) Then we joyfully returned to our game(my sister and the ex-con played my mom) We spent hours there (from 5p.m.-7:15p.m.) There were many people that were the same age as me and my siblings (no one in the room but us were under 30) Us kids had to be dragged kicking and screaming from the bar ( I almost fell asleep during the last game I watched) As we left, there was a feeling of goodwill and fellowship between all(my sister locked me out of the car and wouldn't let me in untill I started yelling profanity in her general direction) The high point of the entire night was when my mother gave me $21 for my report card. She promptly borrowed $1 to help with the waitresses tip(This part I'm not being sarcastic about) All in all it was a night I'll remember forever (as the lowest point in "family outing"history, except for that time my mom dragged me to a church thing on the concept of truth.) My brother(age 13) even decided upon a new job he wants when he's old enough to work, a busboy at the bar. We had to tell him that he would probley have to wait untill he was 21.(Absolutly nothing about that statement was sarcastic) As you can see, I love my families outings(Not unless you're blind...or stupid) &#!#%&&!!!(*%$ WHAT THE %$#@ WAS MY MOTHER $#$#%$# THINKING!!!!!!!???? BRINGING $#$$# KIDS IN A BAR!? I know it was her idea, 'cause my dad hates it, too. My mom and my stupid little 10-year old sister loves it, though. *sighs* Why does my life have to be so weird? I'm leaving...now I'm back! And not so pissed at my weird family. Now is the time to mourn the loss of one of my most loyal readers (I think she's read the entire thing one time, which is more than anyone else has done so far) She has been banned from accesing any portion of the Internet, do to reasons that must remain confidental due to security reasons. If I told you, I'd have to kill you and all that stuff. So...now I am down to one and a half readers. Untill such time that I have more. I wonder why anyone would read this? You would have to have several characteristics that I possess. First of all, you'd have to have an extrodinary amount of free time. Second of all, you would have to have the patience to read through all of this. And lastly, you'd have to know where the heck this site is. I admit it. I haven't exactly advertised this site. Nor can I find it on any search engines. Some of my pages have stuff written in to make search engines recognize me, but it doesn't seem to be working. What must I do to rise above obscurity? I tell people I know about this site, but they either ignore this page, or don't even bother coming to the site in the first place. I suppose that is the bane of all authors. To pour your heart and soul into a passage, and have everyone ignore it. *sniffle* Why must this be? Maybe I should just give up. After all, no one would really care if I quit updating this site. But I can't help but think of stuff like the evil over lord list and REALLY REALLY BIG BUTTON THAT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING. They are not great neccesarily because of the content, (although that helps some) they are great because of their sheer length. You can read a little each day. And almost never finish. Also, I guess I still am trying to get the world record. I have heard some feedback suggesting that I make someway for people to remember where they stopped reading. It can be very confusing, especially if you weren't paying attention in the first place. Well, I dont want to organize this page, in any manner. This is chaos. And insanity. Not neat little text in classifiable rows, in alphabetical order. If you want neat, go to some other site(though, as mentioned in Flaming Chickens Code:472 there is no such thing as a site better than this one). Otherwise, I guess you're stuck with me. Awwwww...I'm touched! You didn't run screaming to another site, thankfull for the chance to escape this insanity. You're still here, which must mean that you'd rather be here than anywhere else! Hey, where are you going?! I thought you were gonna stay here and keep me company?! *drags reader back* See, I knew you'd stay! *gagged reader glares* What's that? I know this is the best site ever, thanks for the compliment! *reader starts inching towards freedom* I better go...I think that I may have a problem brewing. I'm back. And very concerned about this new, younger generation (all 10 year olds who were born in 1992) They are supposed to be the future. Instead they appear to be a nuclear armagedon in the form of a fifth grader. I chanced to have an interview with an informant from this evil generation (my little sister) who will be called Mrs. X for security reasons (no, she's not married, the "Mrs" makes it good as a disguise) I was quizing Mrs. X on Civil War History for an upcoming test in her classroom (whose location can not be devulged) Mrs. X seemed fluent in the subject. Using prior knowledge, I deduced that Mrs. X was full of crap. Out of sheer curiosity, I asked Mrs. X who participated in the Civil War. She immediatly replied "Clara Barton". I clarified, which countries fought in the Civil War. She answered: England, Russia, and (out of sheer desperation) Iraq. I believe that she was just listing countries she knows America has fought against. Now, correct me if I'm wrong...but Iraq? I don't know if Iraq even existed in the Civil War Era! Why on earth would we go have way across the world to fight them when we didn't even really need oil?!! Moving on, I finaly managed to coax my sister (I'm tired of writing Mrs. X) to tentativly guess that America fought in the Civil War. I mean, who'd a thought? America? Fighting in the American Civil War? In a moment of inspiration, I asked her who America fought. Her first guess was enslaved africans. Well, at least she knows that slaves were involved in the war. Before she could start listing all of America's enemies, I gave her a hint. I said "The Union fought..." With a crack, snaple and pop, some random synapses in her brain connected in the right order and she said "CONFEDERACY!!!" I was very proud of her, just as you would be proud of a two-year-old who has just announced: "I WENT POO-POO ON THE POTTY!!!!!" What I mean is, you wouldn't be very proud if the average person said that they just took a dookey on the toilet, and you wouldn't be very proud if they knew who fought against the Union in the Civil War. I confirmed that the Union was Northern and Free, and that the Confederacy was Southern and Slave. We resumed quizzing and she got every question on the worksheet correct. This is because she memorizes the questions. That way, she can pass the test without actually learning anything. You see, if you memorize stuff, you only have to remember that the answer to number 6 is Clara Barton for a week, rather than having to remember that Clara Barton started the Red Cross for the rest of you life. I sincerely appologize if anyone is offended by my view of memorization. I also would like such persons to immediatly leave my site. You don't belong here. You see...knowledge is good. If my sister...uh...Mrs. X were ever asked a question on the Civil War on a quiz show, she'd come up with nothing. With knowledge you can win money and the opportunity to look like a dork on national television. My sister is a big believer in the memorization system. I previous time when I was studying with her (American Revolution, this time) I was trying to help her remember the difference between the Patriots(Patriotic to America) and the Loyalists (Loyal to Britain) She didn't know what the word patriotic meant. I tried to explain. I asked her how you dress on the forth of july (she said nice) I asked what the colors red, white and blue were (pretty). I gave up in exasperation. More recently, I was trying to instill a sense of empathy and niceness in her. I asked her what the golden rule of christianity was. She didn't know. When I pressed her, she confessed she didn't know what chrisianity was. Completly defeated, I told her that it was the religion she practiced every Sunday when she went with her friends to church. This confirmed my suspicion that she only went so that she could have the use of the church's playground equipment. My family also strongly suspects that she stole $20 from the donation thingy. Anyway, that's my rant on the new generation that contains my little sister. When someone of her generation runs for president, I'm gonna do a complete background check. If they're anything like my sister, I'm movin' to Canada. Gotta go...the Russian-Brittish-Iraqi-enslaved-Africans are coming to defeat the Mexicans. I'm back! *there's that darn cricket again* And I have a genuine question to ask all of my loyal readers *cough-cough* Okay, here it is: Is it normal for a non-gender specific sibling to carry around various dead reptiles (snakes, turtles, lizards etc.) Furthormore, is it considered accepted behavior to talk to these dead reptiles, in a cooey, baby talky kind of voice? Finnaly, is it expected for said sibling's non-gender specific parent to encourage such behavior, citing "I was just like that as a child" as an excuse? It's an honest question as I fear that my non-gender specific sibling is weird. Who am I kidding? My entire family is weird. It's just a matter of degree. Hey, by the way. I'm sorry that my last few entries have been only about my various family antics. Although I can't see why you care, because there is a large probability that you do not exist, because I don't think anyone is reading this anymore. How discouraging. People need to make the time to waste time. It's a time honored tradition. Who'd thought that I could use time that many times in only a few sentences? It's been pretty quiet here lately, which is why I haven't added anything to this text in awhile. I know, you were just crushed that nothing new was happening. It's a sad, cold, cruel world out there and you had nothing to relieve the monotony of it. *sniffle* I feel so sorry for you! Next thing you know, you're internet connection will die. Well, too bad! Do you know I never even had a computer untill just a few months ago (that's why I'm obsessivly writing here) So I won't pity you if you're computer dies for unexpected reasons. Time for another quote from the FLAMING CHICKEN HANDBOOK!!! Code: 843 of the Flaming Chicken Handbook states that in no way is the Patron Saint of Paper Clips (guess who?) responsible for any faulty wiring or lack thereof in your computer. The Patron Saint of Paper Clips in no way wishes harm on your computer. Any derogatory statement is simply an opinion of an individual, not of the flaming order of the flaming chickens. Said order will in no way be held responsible for any damages, injuries, loss of life, limb, head, or organs. Okay, quote is done. Maybe I should put quotation marks around them...nah, too much work. But I probably will eventually get around to having a seperate page just for the FLAMING CHICKEN HANDBOOK. That way all the members (what members) can print out a copy of it for themselves (if they didn't get that copy in the mail) I guess I'm done for the day...I know. You want me to stay. It's okay. Because eventually, I'll be back! Seeya! I'm back. And once again suprised. When I was at a TAB poetry thingy (TAB is good TAB is great We love TAB) I met some new people. One of these people (who shall remain nameless untill such time that I have explicit permission to use her name) turned out to be almost as weird as me. As in...she read the ENTIRE Longest Text Ever. The whole thing. So far two whole people (to my knowledge) have read the entire thing, and a few people have skimmed it. That means I really can justify claiming to have two and a half readers! I'm so happy! That means my pointless obsession has actually entertained someone besides me! Perhaps, one day, far in the future, this will actually be a world record and random people will acutally voluntarily read this text every day. Or maybe not. The point is that it is nice to have readers. Or maybe it's not...I mean...won't the quality *snicker* of my work deteriorate if I am no longer writing for the target audience of me? If that happens, then no one will read this. And then I'll be writing for me again. And then the quality will rise. And then people will start reading. And then the quality will go down and the vicious spiral of good and bad will continue untill I either give up this text, or go crazy...er. In any case...I should probably find a topic. Yeah...a topic would be good. Or...I could just continue to write about finding a topic. Ooooo! I know a topic! Ice cream trucks! This has been bothering me for a while. You see...when it's hot, you want something cold to eat. Conviently, ice cream trucks come around during the hottest part of the year (it must be a conspiracy). As you may or may not know, small children swarm the ice cream trucks. The vendors even play whimsical music which I strongly suspect contains subliminal messages to make you hungry for ice cream. The vendors get oodles of cash, and the kids get ice cream. Now, in today's society of buying groceries on-line and getting them delivered, why hasn't any other food industry marketed this ingenius idea to bring the product to the consumer. I can just see Hot Dog, and Pizza trucks roaming the neighbor hoods, selling treats to hungry children...and adults. Of course, said adults would have to peel their butt-cheeks off the couch...but they'd have to do that for the delivary man anyway. The food trucks could even play music that made you hungry for their food. Then the problem with obesity in America would be blamed on evil food truck drivers as opposed to the harmless, benificient television and computer. We could all breath a sigh of relief as parents kept their children inside, away from the evil truck drivers and near the T.V. Gone would be the days when parents told children to play outside, it's a nice day. Parents would buy their children computers, video games and other television neccesities. This, of course would expand the market for such products. This would lead to a better, more stable economy. Food industires would be buying cars, gas and music. Parents would increase the purchase of entertainment items. In return companies would make a profit, pay their workers better. The workers would then be able to afford more entertainment items and the upward spiral would continue, as opposed to the evil downward spiral of my writing. In conclusion, Ladies and Gentlemen...if you implement my idea, there will be peace and prosperity for all. As long as you don't mind a few more couch potatoes. Gotta go...I think I hear a catchy jingle. I'm back...it's been awhile since I've written here. A lot has happened. Like my EVIL school computer deleting my updates page. But it's all good. Especially since I just saw The Matrix: Reloaded. The following text may spoil the movie for you, so WARNING: do no read this unless you have already seen the movie. Okay. What I liked best was the philosophy on choices. (the mindless fight scenes were really cool, too). It's like this. In the beginning of the movie, Neo is having dreams about Trinity's death. Later, The Oracle tells him that he has already decided her fate. Towards the end of the movie, Neo chooses to tell Trinity to stay out of the Matrix, since he saw her die in it. She agrees, but only after seeing how important it is to him. After a horrific chain of events (is it coincidence, or fate) the people who will deactivate the secondary power source of the building Neo is infiltrating, die. So...the plan is going to fail. Unless someone does something, Neo, Morpheus and many others will die. Trinity, who is of course outside of the Matrix, knows this and chooses to enter the Matrix to save the day. The events of Neo's dream unfold. So...when the oracle said that the choice had already been made, she was completely correct. The moment Neo woke from dreams of Trinity's death, he made a choice. He would do everything in his power to keep his dream from becoming reality. So he kept her out of the Matrix, and she saw the problem, and entered the Matrix to fix it. If she had been in the Matrix, she would have likely been with Morpheus, never would have known about the plan's failure, would therefore not have been in the situation that resulted in her death. And the plan would have failed and Neo might have died, along with a large portion of the city (the building was set to blow if there was any intruders) So...Neo's choice to attempt to save Trinity triggered the sequence of events that led to her death. As Neo realizes all of this, through a nearly omniscient Architect of the Matrix, he makes another choice. This choice is simply an extension of his original choice: he will save Trinity at all costs. Neo is told that he has two choices. He can save mankind, and doom Trinity. Or he can try to save Trinity and doom mankind. No guarantee that he'll succeed in saving Trinity. He goes for Trinity, makes it just in time to catch her body, and starts her heart back up. In return for not taking the easy route, he gains a power in the more or less real world. He can deactivate the machines, (squidies) but at great personal cost. The movie ends with him in a coma. Now, you must realize that I have described only one aspect of this movie of all movies. There are not enough words in the English language to describe the sheer coolness of the fight choreography, special effects and the plot. I highly recommend you see the movie yourself. I'm sorry that today's rant isn't random, insane or completely chaotic, but I must right my experience with The Matrix before I forget. I am so buying this movie when it comes out on DVD. I love it! You have to admit its sheer coolness. I mean, come on! It's the sequel to the movie that revolutionized the standard by which we judge special effects. I better stop typing before I have a heart attack...just remember...The Matrix has you...I'm back. And throughly pissed off at my school system in general. You see...they feel that the only way to reward academic achievement...yada-yada-yada...is to force the smart kids to be ushers for Senior Honor Nite, and Graduation. Where is the logic in this? I for one, didn't know about such dire consequences for not deliberatly failing classes. It was bad enough that I was forced to "volunteer" my precious time (i could have worked on this site)...no...I was forced to wear formal attire. My school system is stuck in the past...and formal attire means...a dress...a white dress...(for those you who never bothered to find out...I am indeed female). So...for the first time in about 5 years...I wore a dress...and something that was complelty white. What cruel fate is this? To compound the EVIL situation...I was forced to wear feminine shoes. In other words...they hurt. And they pushed my toes together. Since I have a rather weird phobia of touching my own skin...this made my evening my own personall torture session. I think that such gender-specific torture should be deemed inhumane and abolished from our great society...of flaming chickens. Henceforth...Code: 666 of the Flaming Chickens Handbook states that under no circumstance will the Patron Saint of Paper Clips (guess who) be forced to wear anything other than a t-shirt and preferably black jeans. Should you violate this right, you will become destroyed or possibly dizzy. I'm leaving now...I have some destruction to do. i'm back. from graduation. we had to get there one hour and fifteen minutes early because there was traffic. After standing around a lot...the ceremony started. Lots of people spoke. by the time I had to do my part (tell people where to stand before getting their diploma) it was dark. there were bugs. they liked landing on me. then...i got to go stand while people said a lot of stuff. i couldn't hear it because someone had put the speakers facing the audience. we clapped. the whole time, even during the name-calling, seniors were playing with silly string and beachballs. afterwards...they turned off the lights. there were lots of fireworks. i wandered around for 20 minutes looking for a cell phone. i called home, and waited another hour for my ride...traffic to the school was one way. i felt sorry for my dad. i am tired...but cannot go to sleep. i'll copy and paste this to my site. maybe the longest text ever. you will all suffer as i have suffered when and if you graduate. i cannot feel my feet. i hate dress shoes. I'm back. Today, I'm here to salute the Pointless Signs Of America! The PSOA have been whole-heartedly working for you, and what have you done for them? NOTHING! These so-called "pointless" signs are doing just what they were meant to do: entertain you! You cannot judge them simply because they have no apparant function. They expand your mind, making you think about all the things they could do. They could do anything they wanted to, if they just put their minds to it. If you judged everything by what it doesn't acomplish, then the entire world is populated by pointless beings. Noone can do everything, so how can you expect a SIGN, with the I.Q. of toilet paper, to do everything. You people sicken me. You expect far to much of the inanimate world. The inanimate world, on the otherhand, expects nothing of you. Which is exactly what it gets. If you expect nothing, and get nothing, you feel nothing. If you expect nothing and get something, you're happy. But, if you expect something and get something you feel nothing. And if you expect something and get nothing, you feel cheated. If you're following along, and not completly confused, you'll realize that it is better to be a pessimist than an optomist. Yep that's right. This entry went from saluting the PSOA to making a statement about my ideals. This has been a weird day. You can thank my associate "Meg" she came up with the PSOA acronym. Everyone, clap for "Meg".I gotta go...seeya later! I'm finnaly back! Today, I took a long look at this site, which is the acomplishment of almost a year of work. And I asked myself "How could I have better spent my time?" And so, in the interest of wasting even more time, I made a list. Here we go! Number One: I could have cured cancer. Not that I know anything about medicine...or cancer for that matter. But I'm sure that if I just would have put my mind to it, I could have done it. Number Two: I could helped the earth to find eternal and lasting peace. Which would be boring. So I at least have an excuse for not doing that. Number Three: I could have studied and stuff. Uh...don't think so...Number Four: I could have learned to drive. This would have resulted in the deaths of numerous pedistrians...and I would still probably be wondering around in search of a McDonalds. Number Five: I could have read more books, played more video games and watched more mindless television. Gee...I wish I'd thought of that sooner. Number Six: I could have implemented one of several plans for world domination. Or, as an alternative, I could have ruined several plans for world domination that other people made. Number Seven: I could drive people crazy. Wait...aren't I already doing that? Scratch number seven. And on to: Number Eight: I could have...uhhhh...ummmmm...actually thought up these things before hand. Number Nine: Now it's just getting redundant, isn't it? Number Ten: This is the list that never ends. Yes, it goes on and on my friend. One person, started typing it not knowing what it was, and they'll continue typing it forever just because this is the list that never ends, yes it goes on and on my friends, some person started typing it not...etc, etc. Okay...I admit it. I have officialy run out of ways I could have better spent my time. I don't think there actually are any. Except for maybe five and six. Now, those have possibilities. However, I am currently content to just sit here and type. For the benefit of you, the reader...who may or may not exist. Either way, I'm continuing to sort of entertain myself. I feel like I should be outraged about some topic or another. I just can't work up the energy to be outraged. Perhaps a nice, soothing mistrust. Yeah. I can work with mistrust. I definitly mistrust lots of stuff. Like organ grinders, and the evil conspiracies. Did you know, that Kodak was part of the conspiracy to assasinate John F. Kennedy. Now, some of you are probably thinking "Gee, Really?", or "Wow, I never knew that!" while others are thinking "Who's John F. Kennedy?" or possibly "Who or What is Kodak". I fervently hope that you're not thinking the last two...especially about Kodak. Kodak, as you may know, is a film developing company. And John F. Kennedy (JFK) was an alien bent on global domination. Or possibly a really good president who wanted to fly to the moon. Either way, he got assasinated. And ever loony in America decided that it was a conspiracy. Some even go so far as to claim that Kodak "changed" the pictures of the assasination to make an assasination in the bushes become a tree's shadow. I didn't know that they had such good technology back then. I have to wonder...why would Kodak do such a thing. Perhaps Kodak is actually a front organization for a shadowy governmental system that controls the entire world and didn't want mankind to obtain the freedom of the stars and so tried to sabotauge the space program even though it didn't work as well as they planned. Or perhaps not. Either way, Kodak is undeniably evil. How can any company that takes so many "wholesome" pictures not be? You can just bet that they look at every one that get's turned in to them, judging blackmail value, and whether or not you could get arrested. It's just sickening, you can't even take a simple photo nowadays. Unless you have a digital camera, which are a symbol of freedom from the old ways and willing enslavement to the new ways. We can only hope that the digital camera manufacturers are kinder masters than the evil Kodak Lords. I better go...I think Kodak is tracing my site....I'm back now! And, once again, I have proof that someone actually took the time (two hours) to read this entire Longest Text Ever! It's amazing, it's incredible, it's unbelievable. But true. Even more incredible, this time it's someone I don't even know! Wooooooo! I feel inspired and happy and other really good emotions and stuff. And so, I'll take a trip down memory lane, to the dark depths of the past, to when I decided to make this page. It was inspired, in part, by my sheer and utter boredom. In school, back before I even owned a computer, I'd type random words for long periods of time, 'cause I had nothing better to do. Once I got this computer, I decided to do something similar on my beloved site. But, it ended up making more sense than I anticipated (scary thought, huh). Oh, well...I tired of nostalgia. Back to the present. Right now, I'm just typing so that no one can say that I've been slacking off. I don't think I have any conspiracy theories...except pop-ups/pop-unders. Have you ever had the evil pop-up that says that if you click here, it'll get rid off all the annoying pop-ups? Isn't that sort of ironic? Could the pop-up blocker people have chosen a better means to advertise their product? It's like grand-theft auto 3's talk show, you know, the one where there are Citizens Raging Against Phones? Or CRAP, for short. And the lady representing them, calls the radio station...on a phone. It's stupid and ironic and just shouldn't exist in a better world. Pop-Up ad's help you get rid of pop-up ads? Insane, chaotic...hmmmmm...I wonder who thought of it? Was it on purpose, or was it just some mistake? It is now my civic duty to discover this ancient mystery, and reveal it to the uncaring world. Or maybe I'll go make a frozen pizza. Yeah. That sounds good, too. Since I'm not particualarly inspired at the moment, I should leave and let you gather what is left of your sanity. I just can't seem to stop, though. Okay...I can do it. I'm leaving. I'm back...and it's several hours later. I've decided to imortalize the stupidity of my dog, Moose. She is a heavy-set Yorkshire Terrior (12 lbs.) In otherwords, she's a small yappy dog who is big for her breed. Today, I met her arch-enemy. An enemy so terrifying that Moose cannot stop shaking. An enemy so hideous that Moose must destroy it at all costs. An enemy so dangerous that Moose fears it above all others. Now you may be wondering what horrible beast is Moose's arch-enemy. And you probably suspect that it is something pathetic. You would be correct in your suspiciousness...for Mooses arch-enemy is...*dramatic drumroll*...a small, white, feather. Now, Moose has seen many feathers, birds even. But none have struck terror in her little moose heart like this particular feather. So...naturally I put her arch-enemy in my pocket and brought it home with me. This action has made her very suspicious of where my loyalties lie. She tracks the feather smell all over the house, and goes crazy whenever I take it out of my pocket. She even got her sister and mother in the spirt of things. Now her sister sounds an alarm whenever she sees the evil feather. Now, you may be wondering what is so terrifying about a small, white, feather. So am I. It doesn't smell funny, (I asked my brother, since I don't have a sense of smell), it seems perfectly ordinary. So, I've decided that Moose works for some secret government organization, and that the feather is the key to the destruction of the world, and I am just blithely letting it enter our home, so that it may furthur its evil plans to destroy the universe. That is the only possible explanation as to why it upsets her so much. Or...maybe it's the feather off of the cartoon owl from the tootsie-roll pop comercials (one...two...three..*crunch*). Whatever the case, I decided that the whole world, (or three of four random people) deserve to know that if the world and or universe are destroyed, it's the evil, little, white, feather's fault. Now I'd better go and torture my Moose with it...:) I am officially back. And you, the potentially non-existant reader gets a once in a lifetime chance to hear me rant and rave about my Horrible, Horrible Family Vacation. I know. You feel very, very honored. It's like this. My mother is a control freak, and she decided on the spur of the moment that we were going north to visit relatives. Later that day, she decided we were NOT going north, we were going south to a beach resort. Still later that day, she got offended at some trivial thing and decided that we weren't going anywhere at all. The very next day, she decided that we were going north, after all. So, we packed everthing up. Before we knew it, we were on the road. The first part of the trip was fairly easy. As in, I was half-asleep, hoping that we'd arrive while I slept. Then, in an inspired move, my brother talked my mother into letting him sit up front. That meant that my mother would be in the back, with me and my younger, eviler sister. Immediatly, my mother started complaining. It was uncomfortable in the back, it was too hot, it was too cold. Then, she accidently woke our three yappy dogs up, and they relized that they were in a car. That meant only one corse of action for them. They started shaking and barked their little heads off. This annoyed my mother further, untill she asked, no, demanded that my father turn the car around so that we could go home. Unfortuantly, we had already driven 337 miles toward our destination. After much argument, my father was going to turn around, untill he realized that my mother was going to drop the dogs and me off, and then turn around and continue north. This seemed slightly unpracticle, so we ended up not taking that 337 mile detour. We eventually reached our destination after 16 hours of virtually non-stop driving. We got there, we ate. We slept. My mother visited relatives. And so the week went by. I got to go to a huge library, and see Terminator 3 at the local theater. That was the high point of the entire trip. The last day, we were deciding where to eat. My mom said that she didn't care. So my dad picked a steak place. My mother tried to order a mushroom-swiss burger...only to discover that the place had no swiss-cheese. So she decided on a salad, only to discover that they didn't have her favorite salad dressing. After much deliberation, she decided that she wouldn't eat. After complaining how hungry she was, and about the poor quality of the resteraunt, she walked out of the resteraunt, instructing the rest of us to "enjoy our meals". And I wonder where my little sister gets her annoyingness. Not that my mother is annoying...just set in her ways. The whole meal thing was about the only interesting thing to happen during the week. On the way home, we had gotten approximatly 4 hours into the trip when my mother predicatably decided that we had to go back and eat at the 50th aniversary of her favorite ice cream place. Needless to say, we ignored her. Oh, and when my sister had to go to the bathroom very badly during a traffic jam, my mother had the good taste to making hissing/water noises to make my sister's problem worse. She claimed that my little sister always did it to her, and she was getting pay-back. Between her bickering with my sister, and obsessivly playing neopets games, I don't know what to do with her. Anyway...that was my family vacation rant. It sucked. No suprise. At least it's over. Sorry if I complained a lot. If you don't like it, start your own longest text ever. Anyway, I promise to go back to my usual routine the next time I rant here. I thought of a topic on the way home, but forgot it. Seeya. I'm back! I know, I took you completly by suprise. You thought you'd gotten rid of me. *cheesy super-hero voice* Well, fear not, random citizen, for I, PSOPC am here! *normal voice* Today I have a very important to discuss with you in this: PERFECTLY NORMAL PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCMENT. Yes, that's right. It's time to warn you, the viewer...er...reader...about the evils of various stuff. Today's lesson is: subliminal messages . That's right, folks, mass hypnosis via commercials. Now, I'm sure you've at least heard of subliminal messages , right? No? Well...prepare to be enlightened. Subliminal messages are an advertising technique that puts hidden pictures and words into a main image. You don't see them, but your subconsious (dreaming) mind does. Your subconsious mind acts on whatever it is told. What does this mean to you? It means that WAL-MART TV IS EVIL! EVIIIIIIIIIIIIL!!!!!! Why else would they invest all that money to show commercials in their own store? Because they put subliminal messages in them, of course! Subliminal messanging also explains the successes of certain fast-food resteraunts, and brand name items. BEWARE YOUR TOASTER OVEN! Okay. That had nothing to do whatsoever with subliminal messages...it's just cool to say. Anyway, only watch wal-mart if you WANT to be subliminaly entertained into purchasing a new set of TUPERWARE, even though your old set is PERFECTLY fine. This has been a public service announcment. Pretty cool, huh? Uh...you don't have to take the subliminal stuff seriously. It's true, and all, but I have no proof about wal-mart, or certain fast food resteraunts. It makes sense, though. Wal-mart TV is evil. You cannot deny it. Seeya...hmmm..I wonder if there's subliminal stuff in my computer...I'm back. And I feel that it's time for a FAKE commercial break, for the highly informed, obviously brain-dead consumer. And now, a word from our non-existant sponsor.

I was bored, and a dilligent reader suggested I make fake commercials, so...therer they are. Happy? Good. I'm leavin', for now. I'm back. And I'm willing to enlighten you, the potentially you-know-what reader. Today, I was checking out some weird news. At one point, I read an article that stated that it had been proven, conclusivly, that Kansas was flatter than the standard pancake. The researches even used highly advanced technololgy to map the surface of a pancake and compare it to documented geology of Kansas. Some people disagree, the director of the Kansas Geological Survey said "I think this is part of a vast breakfast food conspiracy to denigrate Kansas. It's a cheap shot." So...doesn't that make you want to take Kansas' side (I sincerly appologize if you are from Kansas). It just seems extremly weird (and worthy of mentioning) that this semi-important guy from Kansas believes in a "vast breakfast food conspiracy". Makes you think that the long held belief that Kodak conspired with the JFK assasin(s) is normal. Another article claims that an anitseptic turned a polar bear purple, drawing large crowds of people. I sure hope other zoos won't copy them. Before you know it, we'll have orange alligators, pink tigers and blue lions. School children won't be able to correctly identify the color of a zebra. Random people will think they've gone crazy, after a seemingly innocent visit to the zoo. It's wrong, I tell you. A complete and total degregation of our societies values. What values, you say? The basic moral belief that Polar bears should be WHITE. Unless we spray-painted the snow purple, too. Then it would be okay. As long as the bear blends in, you know? Speaking of animals, there's a cat in California who is a kleptomaniac (likes to steal stuff). He sneaks into neighboring homes, and takes clothing, wrapped christmas presents, and anything he can find. He then leaves them under his owners car. Okay, better leave. I'm back. And I don't really have a topic today. I'm just bored. Sometimes I just do this, you know? Start typing without any idea about what it is I intend to say. Maybe I subconsiously DO know what I'm doing here, but refuse to admit it to myself. Or maybe I am monumentally bored and don't have anything else to do at the moment. Either way, I'm here. You must be pretty bored, too. Otherwise, why on earth (beta, krpto, zkdjf, Planet X, whatever) would you be here? It would make no sense. If you have something better to do, why wouldn't you be doing it right now? I would be. But, maybe that's just the difference between you and me. Yeah. That must be it. Unless you're bored. Then I completly understand. I need to find a topic. Here, topic, topic, topic! Come on, I won't hurt you, I promise! *hides large ax behind back* Come here, topic! Why are you afraid of little ol' me? *sigh* There are no topics anywhere near me. Kinda like me and "Meg" webcomic we are trying to do. It's called Hit-Or-Miss, any topics, plot, etc. are completly accidental and are not the fault/responsibility of the creators. That was sort of a topic, even though it was sort of random. Which is what I do best. Okay, I'm done with that litte commercial. What now...hmmmmm...should I share with you more of my paranoid/delusional conspiracy theories? Or have I been doing that too much lately? Oooooo! I know, I'll start of list of why it's fun/good to be insane/weird! #1You can say or do anything and normal people will agree with you in the hopes that you'll be satisfied, shut up, and go away. Far away. I will show you an example with this completly true stuff that I experienced several years ago. ME: My vicious, psychotic, flesh-eating bunny-rabbit wants to rule the world. RANDOM PERSON: Uh-huh, that's nice. ME: Yeah, but I told her that she'd be a terible ruler. I mean, she traded Asia for a carrot! And she doesn't even LIKE carrots! RANDOM PERSON: You don't say? ME: Yep. She also is the goddess of red jello. RANDOM PERSON: *head explouding from sheer insanity* As you can see, I was a very weird child (this happened in elementary school...uh...except for that head-explouding part). Okay...on to: #2 You can get out of practically anything by saying: a)It's against my religion b)I'm allergic to that. c)I have an extremly irrational fear of that. d)I already did that in a past life and it sucked. e)My psychotic bunny predicted I'd die doing it. Unfortunalty, several of those reasons LEGITAMITLY apply to a certain activity I do every Tuesday, which WILL NOT BE NAMED HERE LEST I GIVE IT POWER OVER ME! I'm allergic to parts of it, have irrational fears about others and I'm pretty sure it's against my Jenny religion...along with eating mashed potatoes, or potatoes of any kind. I'll add that to the FLAMING CHICKENS HANDBOOK. Thou shalt not eat spuds. Hmmmm...time for #3You can obsessive over ANYTHING, and people will think nothing of it. I, personally, am obsessed with, kitties, bunnies, bats, this website, drawing, making intriate little patterns with strings, doing mildly repetitive activities, being weird, apparantly making lists and cheese...and chickens...and flame. Fire is good. Fire is free. Fire is my friend...until it burns me. Then it must die...painfully. And on to:#4You make your friends look normal in comparison. And #5: You can give each of your pets several weird names such as: Ringling-Raison-Bailey-Suzana-Midnight-Schultz, Squirell, Moose, Moose-Moose, Moosey-Moose, Linzey-Moose, Muffin, Squirell-Muffin, Yabby-Doodle, Abby Normal, Wiggle-Baby, Wiggle-Muffin, Witle-Baby, Cheese-Monkey, Muffin-With-Squirell-Juice, Squirell-With-Muffin Juice, Moosey-Juice, Squirell-Monkey, etc. Now, wasn't that a fun list!? Doesn't that just make you proud to be weird? I should make bumber stickers saying that. Proud to be weird. It'd be cool. Anyway, gotta go! *yawn* I'm back. Last night I was super-charged with lots of sugar and not a lot of sleep. I ended up writing things during the time of night when EVERYTHING is hilarious, including the word sheep. To compound things, I wasn't alone, and things just escalated. The following is everything I wrote during that sugar-coated time period. Some are answers to e-mails, the rest are just stuff I wrote.

Definitly. THen we go to library. Guess what? Me and Josh ate lots and lots of sugar, and it's late at nite and everything is funny but we can't laugh 'cause everybody is sleepin' so it's even funnier but ever since we drank the water we sobered up even though we weren't drunk but we ate sugar...lots and lots of sugar. MOstly donut cake. Okay. JOsh says it was only one piece of cake. WE got it at Wal-mart. Or his mom did. OR something. Goodbye...oh, and the fresh chicken wings might be to blame. they were special wings. I hope I remember doing this. I think it's pretty funny. > You have blue hari..*gigles* I like hair. Josh says I probably won't remember writing any of this, but I can't sleep. THe cake was good. aSk anybody. Big Brother may be listening right now so I beter go. They're listening for a secrret...no it's cause of a secret. But the secret doesn't exist so they are stupid. *g8ggles* bye. Yes. Megan has hair. I've seen it. *giggling* It's very, very late at nite. ONly not really. i like sugar. NO, wait. It's early. WE have been having very profound thoughts lately. We think. THey might havve been important, but we keep forgetting them. We're not sure. Josh wants his thought back. *sniffle* i do, too. It's not fair. I think mine involved a jaunty song to sing. But I couldn't have sung it 'cause it would have woken everyone up and they would have called me inconsiderate. I have to get up really early to leave for home. I should be asleep. *gigles* It milght have been a sugar rush 'cause now we're having a sugar crash. OR, maybe it's the writing. Okay, maybe it was the ranch dressing instead of the special, fresh buffalo wings. But they really were'nt buffoal wings 'cause buffalo's don't have wings...cause they come off when they are babies, JOsh says so and he must be right causse he's been having Profound Thoughts even though he cannot remember them. But, the wings were'nt really special. I don't think. Maybe we're just really, really tired and had sugar. I don't want to play the stupid animal war card game 'cause the stupdi bear gets eaten by an eaagle.. ...goodbye ssslllee0yyyyslllllllleeeeeeeepppppppppppppyyyyyyyyyyy iiiiiiiiissssssssssssss gggggggggoooooooooooooddddddddddddd.............

As you can see, I was in a very interesting state of mind. I hadn't had a genuine sugar rush since I was 11. It was fairly fun. Although I acted like an idiot. Oh, well. I have more stuff to write, but I gotta go right now. Stay tuned to hear my thoughts on tanning, and an evil card game, and who knows what else...Okay I'm back. Here's what I wrote this weekend: Woooooo! 5000 hits! Aren't I special? *sigh* I can't think of anything to write. But I must. I must defeat the sister site of the Longest Text Ever! I mean, I've been doing this much, much longer than the other person. Hmmmmm...monkey. Why do weird people (myself included) obsess about monkeys? And, are monkeys spelled monkies? It just looks weird. Like a division of mounties made entirely out of monks. I bet it's spelled monkeys. It looks right. Maybe I should use spell-check. But...that'd be a lot of work, unlike ranting, raving and rambling. Hey, it's the 3 r's! No longer does school teach use reading, riting and 'rithmitic, it now teaches us ranting, raving and rambling! (and redundancy!) After all, isn't that basicly what the best teachers do? It sets a perfect example for you young, impressionable minds. Those are the best kind. *yet another highly dramatic, time-consuming sigh* I need a topic. A good one. Not one of those bargain ones anyone can find at your local topic discount outlet store. I'll rant and rave and ramble about the EVILS of sunlight. Most people actually like to spend long periods of time exposing their vulnerable skin to the harmful rays of the sun. These people have obviously suffered major brain damage from their prolonged exposure to the sun. The actually think that their skin's efforts to protect them are ATTRACTIVE. It'd be like someone thinking that scabs are atractive, 'case they protect you from disease. Then everyone would cut and scrape themselves to be covered in scabs. That's exactly what tanning is like. Purposly damaging the skin so you can look "attractive". Now, a long time ago, people were sort of smarter. They avoided the sun at all costs. They associated tans with hard, manuel labor. Then, some fasion bimbo went on a fasionable safarii to get some fasionable furs, or whatever. When she came back, 'lo and behold, she had a tan. This resourceful young vanguard of fasion decided to cover her extreme embarassment by acting like she meant to horribly damage herself. And because she was the head fasion bimbo, everyone agreed that the look was definitly "in". So, everyone went to the beach and got tans. Girls began wearing skimpier, and skimpier bathing suits. Men, of course, had no complaints. (Though whether it was the tan or the skimpy suits, no one will ever know.) As you read this Historicly Accurate Anecdote, you must realize the parallel between it and the fable The Emperoro's New Clothes. Someone did something incredbly stupid, but because they were powerful, everone acted like it was a stroke of genius. And the preceding generations became brain-washed (possibly through subliminal messages in sun-tan lotion commercials) to believe tans were expected. Those few who actually could think and avoided the sun were considered to be outcasts. I don't mean to insult you if you DO have a tan. I am simply explaining why I, personally, refuse to swim, go to the beach, sunbathe, leave the house, etc. Alrighty then. I'm gonna quit for now. I'm back. I'm so very, very tired. School has been on for four days now. I have three very hard academic classes. They give lots and lots of homework. Two and a half hours of homework (total) to be precise. I get home from work at 5:30p.m. and eat dinner. Then I do my homework. I get done at 9:15. Then I wait for my mom and dad to stop playing Collapse II so that I can get on. I usually have less than 30 minutes. It sucks. I can't really work on this site even though I now have a more in depth understanding of variables. I learned this from my calculator. I made a virtual pet for it. It was fun. I'm tired. Did I mention that, yet. My calculator is nifty. Sometimes, it is lazy. It tells me stuff like: "Warning: More Solutions May Exist" and "Questionable Accuracy". So...it doesn't bother to find all solutions, and it may be wrong. Geee....that is comforting. I love my calculator, though. It does all my Math for me. I hate Math. Math is so picky. In English, and stuff, if you miss one little detail, at most you lose partial credit, but you usually get it all right. In Math, one teeny, tiny little mistake will make you get the entire thing wrong. I tend to make those tiny mistakes, and get bad grades, even if I understand the concepts. I hate Math. I'm tired. Are you tired. I sure am. Guess what I wanna do. How did you ever guess? That's right, I wanna sleep. Why can't I? Hmmmm...good question. I think I'm so tired I can't sleep. Plus...I gots oblimagations...obligaton....obligations to this site. yeah. thats it...i so tired...bye-bye. I'm back. And more than slightly embarassed. Today my frazzled-brain produced something that is decidedly Jenny (that's my more or less "real" name). I was contemplating how my heavy load of books made me like a bulldozer and than I was about to suggest to my friend, "Meg" that we invent one. Then I realized that the buldozer already HAD been invented. That's how I knew it's name, picture and what it did. That is just...pathetic. School is taking its toll. *sigh* *sniffle* *snort* *insert word that is a sound that begins with an "s" here* I don't have much time, so, I must be brief. I'm not sure how I CAN be brief since I have absolutly nothing to say. The best way to be brief is to quit now. Right now. Which is what I'm about to do. Any miniute now. I promise. Okay. Bye! *sigh* My dogs are just weird. You remember my Moose's arch-enemy, don't you? You know, the small, white feather. Well, my squirell now has an arch-enemy. At least her's makes sense...sort of. Her enemy is a fake Yorkshire Terrior (same species as her) made entirely out of goat hair. She HATES and FEARS it. She'll shake and run from it, then suddenly dive and bite it's head. She goes crazy if someone holds it, 'cause it's getting attention and not her. I'm fairly certain she knows it's not alive, though. Maybe she just doesn't like goat-smell. In any case, she is clearly insane. Just like everyone else in my family. In other news, I participated in the Second Battle of the Asparagus Wars and chronicled them here. I'll add a link to the main page when I get around to it. It gave me new insight into how weird I am. I fought with vegitables, covered myself in bubble wrap, groveled before the Great Banana and dodge skittles and flying doughnuts and rubber chikens. The entire message board was like one big insane asylum. Needless to say, I felt right at home. Well, seeya *waves brightly* I got to go to my Grendel (really cool book) project for school. I's making fake soundtracks like the teacher told me! BYE!!! Okay...I'm back. Today's rant is a panic rant. There are not going to be conspiracies...or humor of any kind. I think. *let the panic begin!* IT'S NOT FAIR! Why do I have to work year round? I only signed up for a semester. I was looking forward to having A elective, while everyone else was enjoying three or four...or even more. Oooo..I'm a poet, and don't I know it? In any case...it's awful. It's bad enough to go to school, leave school, go to work, leave work, do homework and then wait for my dad to get off of the computer so that I can do stuff. I want SOME free time. That's all. Is that too much to ask? I spend from 8-5 doing what everyone else wants. When is it MYturn? Next semester will be almost exactly like this one. Even though my schedule is technically supposed to be completly differnt. You see, my school has "block" scheduling. That means I take four classes this semester and four different classes next year. But one of my classes is work, and two others are horrible year-round classes. So next semester I'll still have work, AP Lit, and AP Physics. It's not FAIR. Physics is so FREAKIN' hard! I don't understand it. I have no problem with Lit. Okay. Work. I love my work, I love the kids I work with. But I HATE spending three hours of every day in a "class" when everyone else's class is only an hour and a half. I don't care if I have to ride the bus home if I stop work. I don't care if I'd get home only an hour or so before I normaly do. I want an elective. Maybe. I think. All I know is that I've been assuming one thing while the person in charge has been assuming a completly different thing. Neither of us thought to question the other. And so I'm in deep doo-doo. *sniffle* I just want to have some FREAKIN' variety in my daily grind, you know? I don't WANT to do the same thing for an entire year. Yeah, I know, regular schedule schools do that. I pity them, I really do. I've spent the past three years of my life EXPECTING each semester to be like a mini-year. I DO NOT LIKE CHANGE! This is just way too much of a change at once. I don't want year-round classes. I don't want a full year of work. I don't want to be in this mess...I'm going to bed. I'm back. I don't have much of a choice about the whole work thing. Plus, the kids at the daycare (where I work, obviously) say that I'm "cool to talk to". That makes me feel alll warm and fuzzy inside. Like a muffin. They just like how I know lots of pointless laws and random facts. Okay. ON TO THE CONPIRACY OF THE DAY!: I've had this nagging fear that I am part of some random but vast conspiracy (about what I'm not sure but it must be vast). Meanwhile there is a vast conspiracy at school to keep me ignorant about my pawn roll in the other vast conpiracy by keeping me vastly bored. (In a very vast sense) And: did you ever notice that the word "conspiracy" is vastly similar to the word "constipation". I only mention this 'cause I've accidently spelled constipation instead of conspiracy a few times. (on accident, vast number of times) Hee-Hee! Isn't vast a funny word? You can just picture sterotypical pirates saying, "A vast ye mateys!". I'm not exactly sure what that means, but it sure is funny:) You don't agree? Shame on you! Code: 888 of The Flaming Chickens Handbook states that The Patron Saint of Paperclips (still me) is always right. ALWAYS. If the facts beg to differ, than the facts are wrong. End of story. Seeya. I'm back. I've been playing one of the new neopets slot machines (black pawkeet). I'm completly and totally addicted. Gambling is so much fun! I've won 500 np, at least and I'm on a roll. Now sure, I could have won more than 500 at some game in which you don't have to pay to play. But, what would be the fun in that? I even came up with a mathematical explanation for why gambling is fun (while I was eating a hyper-speed dinner, thinking nothing of getting back to the slot machine). Okay. If you don't understand the concept of numbers less than zero, (negative numbers) just skip this part. Imagine a number line that points in the positive and negative direction. When I start playing a game, I am on 0. I have neither won nor lost money/neopoints. When I win 500np on a normal game, I move to the 500 point. There is exactly 500 units of distance between the two extremes of winning amounts (0 and 500) BUT! When I play a gambling game, there is a possibility that I'll lose everything, so I start on negative however much NP I have with me. If I had 500np with me, I'd be at-500. Then, when I win 500 additional np, I move to the 500np point. The distance between the two extremes of how much I could have won is 1000np, making me feel like I've won much more than if I'd played a normal game. Did you understand that? Good. I probably won't later. But that is irrelevant. Goodbye! I am back. And I hava a very, almost special rant for you. The previous sentence made absolutly no sense. Good for it. In a recent article, humorist Dave Barry discussed the addictive quality of the snack food, Cheez-Its. Naturally, I had many mixed feelings, primarily disgust, as I have not voluntarily eaten a Cheez-It in quite some time. They're disgusting, bland and definitly not made of cheez, whatever that is. My family has always bought Cheez-Its, to the point of making me physically sick at the thought of eating one. (To this day, however, I will almost literally kill for a box of Cheez-It party mix, as it is a rare commodity at my house.) Fortunatly, my mom recently finnaly switched our snack food preference. To Cheese Nips. Say it. Out loud. What does it sound like? When you look at them they are identical to the evil little Cheez-Its. The only difference is the taste, which I enjoy, since it is new and different. What I want to know is this: are there no intelectual property rights in the world of food products? I mean, don't you think the creators of Cheese-Nips had a box of Cheez-Its out when they were designing their product? It seems like blaggerent plagerism. The only reason the makers of Cheese-Nips don't get sued is because of the tast difference and Cheese Nips are made of real "cheese" rather than cheez. It makes you think of Name-Brand vs. Generic cereal brands. They are the samething, with the same look, and almost same name. But people buy name brands. Why, because they assume it's better quality. Plus, boxes are more convient than bags. A profound statement, if I ever heard one. Any way, I'm leaving to eat some Cheessy goodness! I'm back. Apparantly my standards of weird have gone up. This morning, my Mom came home from work. She was upset, because she had accidently run over an armidillo. She said she hurt it the first time, and wanted to put it out of it's misery, so she went back and ran over it 11 more times. But it's legs were still moving and it was alive. She was extremly upset. When I related this story to my friends (including "Meg") they thought it was hilarious. They couldn't stop laughing. I thought it was sad...and normal. They particularly liked how I said that she went back and ran over it 11 more times. I'm not sure why. Of course, when I next saw my Mom, she retold the story to me, several times. With the exact same words, motions and emotions. She didn't think it was weird, either. Perhaps my family is just so weird, we've lost all sense of perspective. Or maybe it's everybody else that's weird. I just don't know. What do you think, Hypothetical Reader? You don't know either? Hmmmmm...what is this world coming to? Oh, by the way, I was paid a decent compliment today. One of my friends (who laughed at the armidillo story) named Tonileigh said "Jenny (that's me) is weirder than the average Psycho." and " You think Jenny's weird? Wait till you see her in angry mob form!" Now THAT'S just weird. "angry mob form"? That just sounds nifty! I can clone myself and form and angry mob? In anycase, this was particularly funny because Tonileigh is one of my "normaler" friends. Although I tell you she can't possibly be normal, since she hangs out with me. Anyway, I'm gonna go. I gots stuff to do! I'm back. If you'll look toward the bottom of this page, you'll notice that I added a nifty little thing called the "babel fish". It will translate any thing, to anything else. Ain't it nifty? What's really fun is to translate an English saying, like out of sight, out of mind. Then, when it's in German, or whatever, translate it back to English. It's so completly garbled, it's funny. For instance, I wrote: "I am the Crazy Taco!", and translated it to German. I then copied and pasted the German and put it in the text box. I translated it from German to English and got "I am the Moved Taco!" See? Hours of completly useless fun! This has been my hourly Public Service Announcement that I only do when I feel like it. Seeya! I'm back! Woooo! And do I ever have a topic today! I've been a paranoid, conspiracy seeking mood lately and the newest threat to my sanity is: smoke detectors! Come on, think about it! In all those 911 shows, people wake up and their house is engulfed in flames. The smoke detector either never went off, or went off and the people just slept through it. Okay, fire is loud. And hot...and smoky. If you can sleep through a raging fire, close enough to set off the smoke detector, then you are definitly going to sleep through the smoke detector. Plus, the fire gradually gets louder, and hotter, and smokier. The sleeping person will gradually get used to it (and incorporate it into their dreams). By the time the smoke dector goes off, the fire has drowned it out to no more than an annoying buzz. My point is that smoke detectors have very little value in home security. Okay, one day, in the future, smoke dectectors will probably activate litte fire-fighter bots that every home will have. But untill that day, the concept of the smoke detector is useless. If you're awake to hear it, chances are that you've already noticed the smoke, fire and eminent danger. If you're asleep, the fire will wake you. So, that leads us to the evil paranoid conspiracy I thought of the other night. What if the smoke detectors have tiny litte cameras in them? That would explain that annoying green little blinkie light in them. Unless, of course, the government was smart enough to have cameras without the blinkie light. In any case, wouldn't the blinkie light help night-vision cameras see in the dark? It only takes a little light to help those thingies, and smoke detectors provide more than a little. I can even see the shadow of my hand on the wall from the light those things shed. It's annoying. Here I am, trying to get a decent nights sleep and there's this green light that periodically blinks to red directly in front of me. It's a small light, but it's sooooooo annoying. There MUST be some sort of conspiracy involved, 'cause if there is, I can get rid of the EVIL thing! So, fellow conspiracy nuts: Take down the evil governmental safety device and take it apart. If you can still think during all that incessent beeping, you'll probably find evidence that I'm really paranoid. Or possibly right...that would be scary. In any case...I guess that smoke detectors are a neccesary evil...but...WHY DO THEY HAVE TO HAVE THAT STUPID LIGHT? Does it serve an obvious purpose? No! That's why it MUST be EVIL! You cannot deny the logic of my thinking! Now...I'm gonna go and worry about the light on my toaster oven...seeya! *sighs dramatically* I'm back. It's not fair, ya know? Each Friday, I wait (all tingly with anticipation) for the weekend so that I can stay up 'till the wee hours of the morning and sleep past noon. But my idiotic body has an automatic alarm clock, or something. During the weekdays, I get about seven hours of sleep (usually less) and wake up at 6:11 a.m. Yep. Now, some of you are probably calling me a whiner, 'cause you have to get up at 4:30, or whatever. And lots of you are probably gloating 'cause you don't have to get up 'till 8:30. The reason I have to get up at 6 something is that I...I...I ride the bus to school. Yeah...I know...pathetic. (Believe me, though, you never want to see me drive...I get easily distracted by clouds and signs saying FREE KITTIES!...kitties are hugable...but if you hug them...they'll scratch your eyes out...so then you have to hiss at them and establish dominence...but kitties don't like that...even though dogs do...but kitties are obviously not dogs...even though they are fuzzy.) So...my lack of a car and driving skills force me to use the bus, which comes for me 45 minutes before my school even starts. It's stupid. It only takes me a few minutes to get ready, then I can go back to bed. Now...I bet you're wondering why I don't just wake up a few minutes before I have to go. My sister. My evil, EVIL sister. That's why. She's evil. SHE has to get up at 6:11 to put on make-up, do her hair and basically annoy the heck out of me. So rather than battle her over the concept of getting dressed in the dark, I get up. Oh...I'm rambling again, aren't I? Back to the original topic! So...when the weekend rolls around, I'm fairly exhausted. But, my stupid internal alarm clock is starting to wake me up around six. I can usually fall back asleep (if I don't panic and think I'm late for school), but the stupid thing wakes me up again exactly seven hours after I originally fell asleep. Which is why it's not even 10:00 and here I am, typing. Which I suppose may be a good thing, seeing as how I'm currently in a Longest Text Ever Rivalry with Galaxy Dreamer's site. *cough*She's winning*cough* But that's just because I have so much to do to mantain and update this site, I rarely get a chance to just sit here and type. Oh, and I would like to mention to my *snicker* LOYAL fans that this Longest Text Ever DOES get updated at least once a week, so please, please, please, PLEASE do not read this once, in one sitting and then leave forever, and ever and ever! It makes me sad...*sniffle* Well...I feel better now. Did you know that I now possess a DOMAIN NAME? Yep. That's right! It'll be ready soon, ain't it great? Okay, back to the flaming-chickens LTE rivalry. Another reason why this isn't as long as Galaxy's is that I refuse to write every day as it would--this is the funny part--LOWER THE QUALITY OF MY OVERALL WORK! HA-HA! HILARIOUS! "lower the quality"? Sometimes I crack myself up. If this was quality work, I'd publish it and make a fortune. Speaking of publishing, I do plan on somehow, someday publishing this as the first rambling narrative that makes no sense, and is about as interesting as rereading the almanac. I'd probably lose money, but the concept is interesting. I think. Anyway, I better go or the quality of this will go down in that evil downward spiral thing I discussed a few months back. Seeya. I'm back. Wooooo! I's can get to my site again! It was down for a whole day or so 'cause of all the traffic I got from my new quizes. I have an extra-special rant for you all today, to celebrate the new domain name! www.flaming-chickens.com! Okay. I am now barophobic (afraid of gravity). I recently learned in my EVIL Physics class that on average, humans lose one inch of height during the day due to gravity pushing on their spine. The height is regained at night, when you're laying down. This naturally alarmed the HECK out of me! GRAVITY IS EVIL! It's pushing down on me, squishing my spine. MY SPINE IS SQUISHY! That's is just so extremly creepy. What if, eventually, Earth's gravity get's very very strong, and we all imploud from the squishyness? It'd be like when you go to the bottom of the ocean, only with gravity instead of pressure...*shudders* Pressure is evil, too. Air pressure. Did you know that there is over two miles of air sitting on you right now? Even though air is light, that much air adds up. TWO MILES? Even the air is conspiring to squish me! If you don't believe that all that air has weight, try going into space sometime. Space is notorious for not having air. When you're in space (without a space suit) you don't SUFFUCATE, you don't FREEZE. You exploud. Since all that nifty air isn't pressin' on you, your guts and stuff are free to go wherever they want, and the EVIL little things decide to roam around. Outside your body. It's creepy. So...air pressure can be a good thing. Even though it gains pleasure from squishing my spine. That's it, I'm gonna take drastic measures! I'm gonna launch THE OFFICIAL FLAMING CHICKENS LUNAR COLONY! The moon has one-sixth of Earth's gravity. And absolutly NO air-pressure. We can all wear spiffy space-suits and feel all superiour to all those stupid earthlings. So...if you wish to contribute to this great and magneficent and magestic and MOOSEY project...we need the following things: 739 rolls of aluminium foil (preferably the extra shiny kind) 417 refridgerator boxes, 9000 rolls of "sticky on both sides" duct tape, 300 lbs of chicken feathers (preferably white) and 1 (one) thermo-nuclear-rocket-thruster. If you can spare any of these items, please e-mail them to me. Yes. E-mail. Did you really think I'd give you guys my ADDRESS? Now...I know what you guys are thinking...some of those items on that list are gonna be hard to find. Especially that duct tape. But, believe me, it's MUCH more practical than the alternative. What is the alternative, you ask? I'll tell you. Making me(The Patron Saint of Paperclips) the Ruler of the Laws of Nature! That way I can just outlaw the need for gravity and air pressure! I'm already half way there, since I conclusivly proved (in Physics class) that gravity actually causes things to slow down and EVENTUALLY GO UP! Sure, my TEACHER said that was because I was doing the problems wrong, but once I'm the Ruler of the Laws of Nature, I'll change the problems so that I'm right! Oooo! I thought of another very good reason to assist with the Official Flaming Chickens Lunar Colony! As we all know, the world is going to end in about 380,695 days! This means that we only have a very short while to prepare. And I sugest that we build the rocket so that we can go to the Official Flaming Chickens Lunar Colony so that we can laugh at the stupid earthlings who are blowing up because they didn't listen to us when we tried to warn them about the impending doom! Once we are on our Lunar Landing Site, we will engage in many exciting activites, primarily related to suffucating and starving. If (and this is a big if) the world DOES survive, we can beg them for food, oxygen and other supplies. They'll probably just call us weird and laugh at us, but that's beside the point! I can even see the Official Flaming Chicken Rocket. It'll be covered in chicken feathers, and shaped like a chicken. The foil will make up the beak and the folded legs, and the thruster can simulate the tail. It will be a truly magestic site, as it launches from the earth, spewing excess oxygen, cardboard, feathers and tape. But, act now, or it will be too late, and you will be one of the losers that we'll be laughing at, assuming we have air to laugh with. Remember, e-mail psopc@flaming-chickens.com the much needed supplies...if that is possible. If not, then some day, when the Internet is down and I'm really bored, I will construct a model OFCR and attempt to launch it. That will be a wonderous day. I think I'll get my little sister to be the test piolet. Well...better go...I need to plan this out more...I'm back. And mildly weirded-out. My dad...was on this site. My dad. It even SOUNDS weird. He took the TAB member quiz and turned out to be me, he took the JOB quiz, and was a repo man (which had a pic of my brother) He said he wanted to see what I was doing, and to make sure that I wasn't saying anything derrogatory about my parents. He looked me upvia yahoo's search engine using flaming-chicken as the keyword. It took him to my quiz page. So he probably didn't see the majority of my site. It's just weird. All along, my entire family has scoffed (nifty word, isn't it?) about my site, and called me weird. I dunno...I guess I'm just kinda freaked out. Oh, and don't forget to celebrate Mad Hatter Day on October the 6th. Seeya. I'm back. I had some conspriacy or another to rant about. But then I listened to some of the new music I put on my site and mellowed out. I can't remember what I was gonna rant about. Oh, yeah. Now I do. "Purified" water. Just wait a sec while I stop the music. *content sigh* There we go...that's much better. Now I can think. That's right, folks. "Purified" water. Now...just stop a second and contemplate that. Pure means, well, no extra stuff. 100% of something. Right? Well, next time you buy your $3 FREAKIN' dollar bottle of water, consider this. On almost all the "purified" water bottles I've ever seen it has the following mesage: "Purified through reverse osmosis. Minerals added for a pure, fresh taste." In other words, they take all that extra "stuff" out to make it pure. Then they add other "stuff" in to make it TASTE pure. But it's not. For all you, the uninformed consumer, could know, it might have rat poison in it. "Pure" water manufactuerers are not required to list the ingredients of water, because the average consumer believes that it should be obvious. But that is false! They add random minerals to our water to make it taste better, and then advertise it as pure! It's an outrage! I'd rather drink the "impure" tap water where at least I KNOW that someone, somewhere tested it. It's a law, I think. But does anyone test "pure" water? Most likely they test it BEFORE they add the extra stuff..."Yep, Bob, this is some mighty pure water." "Yep, Bill, time to dump the arsnic in so it tastes pure!" What kind of reasoning is that? Wouldn't pure water TASTE pure, and impure water TASTE impure? The insanity and stupidity is mind boggling! That's why I like fast-food salt. It actually lists what random minerals they through in to make it TASTE like salt. There's salt, of course, and aluminum sulfate, and other compounds. But the point is, if I were, say, freakily allergic to a random mineral, I could read the ingredients and not eat the salt. That's what they need to do with the water. Or, at the very least, not label it as "pure". Okay. That's the rant of the week, month, year, whatever. I'll probably have another one soon, but that whole water thing has been buggin me for awhile. Well...seeya! Er...yeah...I'm back. It's been awhile, (at least two weeks) since I've written here. I've been obsessed with various webcomics, creating the stupidly long new Phobia Quiz and being maniacly hysterical about my site always being down due to bandwith issues. I'm goin' light on the advertising at the moment, which is why I'm free to write here. I WANT to write. But I can't think of anything to write about. Typical. I finnaly get some free time to rant and rave and all my topics just magically melted away. Let's see...what have I ranted about before, subliminal messages, vast breakfast cereal conspiracies, water, uh...reality tv? And that's just what I can list from memory. Oh, yeah! How could I forget the stupid Tootsie Roll Pop Commercials? TACO is still in my heart. *sighs*...now...let's see...what to rant about today... ... ... ... ... I can't think of anything!? Is this writer's block?! Or maybe I just wanna go to bed. Sleeping is fun. Well...let's see. Did you know that statistics prove that 45% of all statistics are completly made up by me (The Patron Saint of Paperclips)? Well...they are. Ha! I see you have no reaction to that, do you Hypothetical Reader? I have once again caused that explody sensation in your brain meats! You cannot DEFEAT me! I rule the...er...*random Loyal Minion whispers in ear* That's right! I rule the Internet! The Official FLaming-Chickens Handbook already confirms that fact! You CANNOT DENY it! It says that in black and...er lime green! It MUST be true! Because it is in those veyr colors that the Matrix is programmed! Ahhh...I see your confusion! You cannot follow the vast, mind-boggling logic that is ME! Wait...how...how can I BE logic? That doesn't make any sense...you can't BE something abstract...can you? Now MY brain meats feel explody. That's not fair! I see your EVIL plot now, Hypothetical Reader! You just let me rant on and on for you KNEW that eventually I would confuse myself with my vast puddle of knowledge. You are devious...I give you that. Unfortunantly...I must leave...before the confusion spreads and I do something stupid...like revealing my one weakness before you...THAT'S IT! Code 452 of the Flaming Chickens Handbook states that the Patron Saint of Paperclips (ME!!!) does not, has never, and will absolutly NOT admit to having any weakness...besides the aformention indivduals own skin, which isn't even a weakness anyway since no representative of the Dark, Fluffier Side can BE the Patron Saint of Paperclips (Guess, who...no...no...THAT'S IT!) and even if they could it wouldn't do them any good because it would scare them instead of the aformentioned individual. Boy...I really enjoy confusing myself!:) Seeya! I'm baaaaa-ack! Aren't you happy? Here, see if you can find the super-secret message!

While you wait for yesterday's tomorrow, lunge back and remember that day.  You know the one.  Yeah, this doesn't mean anything to you.  Are you surprised?  Obviously not.  Answer me, you blobby looking freak! Or suffer my blindingly moronic nail messages.
Did you find it? Wasn't it super? And secret? I thought it was. But then, I'm me...and you're you. I think. I'm pretty sure you're not me...but you could be that other guy. Yeah...that...guy...you know who I'm talking about. No? Do not MOCK me! I know where you are right now! Spooky, huh? Ooooo...time for today's topic. My favorite stuff...JTHM...I have my libraries copy of JTHM...I shall quote Noodle Boy for you:) (Full copyright/credit to Jonhnen Vasquez for writin' the stuff, I'm just sharing the spleeny goodness with you). (it's edited, of course, to stay PG13...**** signifies a random naugty word:)) "HEY, DOG ENTITY! RISE UP AND BARE YOUR BISCUIT FILTY FANGS AT THE LEASH WIELDING DEMON!! **** MY NAVEL ITCHES!! MEOW!MEOW!MEOW! CAT CHOW!!! CEASE YOUR FLATULENT WINDS AND HEAR MY MIND NUMBING EXPULSIONS OF WICKED NOISE! GRRR!! CHEESE!!! I SENSE YOUR ENVY OF MY NECK!! AND I DONT BLAME YOU!! DROOOOOL OVER MY MAGICAL POWERS!! I HAVE POWERS PINTO BEANS CAN ONLY DREAM OF! WANNA SEE ME PULL A TAPEWORM OUTTA MY ****!! HUH?!...STARE DEEP INTO THE STINKING ABYSS OF MY INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED SLICES!!! HOLY WAX! CHECK OUT MY ARMPITS!!! HEEEEY! WAIDAMINIT!! WAIT JUST A POLYP PICKING MINUTE!! I SEE YOUR GAME! YOU WILL NOT SINK MY CHEERIO!! I SEE WHAT IS TRANSPIRING HERE!!! YOU'RE ALL ZOMBIE THIGH-FAT PEOPLE BROUGHT INTO ANIMATION BY SOME EVIL FORCE OF FORCEFUL EVIL!!! **** THAT LIPSTICKS THE WRONG COLOR FOR YOU!! MOOOO! WOOF! OH, DON'T YOU SEE THE TOENAILS?!! OH, SO SPLENDID!! A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K...! UNDER SUCH EXTREME HEAT, WEAR AND DEGRADATION IS INEVITABLE!! PARTS BREAK AFTER OVERUSE!! AND THAT IS WHY TOASTER PASTRIES WILL BURST INTO FLAMES IF YOU DON'T KEEP AN EYE ON THEM! Now, wasn't that entertainment. I added to the lenghth of the LTE without even thinking! That's talent. Lots of gooey talent. Unfortunatly, I once again am devoid of a topic. And any weirdness I could come up with would be normal compared to Noodle Boy, so...I bid thee farewell...seeya! I'm back. And I've realized that I am a complete idiot. For an ENTIRE MONTH I have possesed the arcane knowledge, but I forgot to share it with you, my loyal potentially imaginary reader. I know. You're shocked at my selfish, bad, memory. I apologize from the depths of my moosey soul. For, you see...my life long goal has been fufilled...*anticipatory silence*...THERE ACTUALLY IS GRAPE PIE!!!! I know...you are as shocked as I am. One day I was randomly looking up images via Google...and 'lo and behold, there it was. Grape Pie. It was as if it had been just sitting there...waiting for me to discover it. Apparantly Grape Pie isn't mainstream, but it has existed for some time. In obscure cookbooks. Well...that just makes me filled with gooey happiness. Of course, there is also regret...after all, I could have made a fortune if I'd been the first to think of it. Oh, well. There was something else I had to tell you loyal *cricket chirps, someone coughs* fans. I can't remember what. I guess I'll just rant and rave about that whole vicious downward spiral of my writing. I mean, I KNOW people are coming here...I have proof! *holds up a piece of paper, which, from a distance, appears to have writing on it* Yes, undenyable proof! But this proof degrades this mysterious, mystical and mystifying "quality" of my words. After all, how can I be self derisive, and full of low expectations for this site if I KNOW people are here...several thousand of them in fact, in just a few months. It's strange. I felt more fufilled when this site was a barren wastland of useless space. But, if it had remained that way, I would have had no impetus to continue my pointlessly insane ranting. Oh, speaking of insane, I STILL need those much needed supplies for the Official Flaming-Chickens Lunar Colony! No one has even bothered to e-mail them to me...*sniffle*. I needs the duct tape! How can I survive without the sticky goodness? HOW, I ask you!? It cannot be...hmmmm...maybe I should just use IMAGINARY duct tape...it's easier to come by ,but it's much more expensive...I'm not sure what to do. *enter Squirell* What's that, little Squirell? That's just silly. You KNOW I ran out of imaginary money last week when I bought that imaginary country. WHAT!? Just "imagine" I have more!? What a crazy idea. So crazy it just might work! *scrunches eyes and makes funny sounds* Nope. It didn't. I guess I'll just have to wait untill my imaginary clone hijacks that imaginary bank truck. Until then...I have absolutly no imaginary money. What ever shall I do? I won't be able to feed my various imaginary pets and friends their beloved imaginary food! Squirell? You gots extra money, don't you? *nods* I thought so. You give to me? No? I gives you imaginary IOU's...here...yours. Thank you Squirell. *Squirell wanders off in search of electrical sockets to sniff* What's that, Hypothetical Reader? You don't know who Squirell is? You haven't been paying attention have you? She's my little puppy...she fears grape flavored stuff, wind, rain, television, noise, silence, small children and pretty much everything. She likes sniffing potentially dangerous stuff, like electrical sockets. Surely you have heard of her? Still no? Oh, well. You know...I enjoy having these conversations with you. It really lets me get to know you. What's that? You say I'm really just talking to myself? What an eccentric idea! To think, YOU are trying to tell ME that YOU aren't here. How absurd. After all, I'm talking to you, aren't I? *nods* Well, yeah...I KNOW I'm actually typing instead of talking. Wait a minute...so you're saying that I'm talking and responding to you, but you won't be reading this until long after I have finished typing? Now who's the crazy one? For that theory to work, I'd have to be psychic...or in possesion of a freaky time-traveling computer. Because what you're saying is that I'm talking to people in the future. That my words somehow travel accross time (if only a few minutes) and are somehow picked up by future you, and that my responses are dictated by future you's reactions. What? You mean that I'm just randomly responding regardless of your reactions? Why, that would be insane, wouldn't it? That's the point you're trying to get across? *pauses* Oh. I see. You wanna play that way. Well...two can play by THOSE rules. You wanna try to convince me I'M crazy? Well, look at you? How do you know I even exist? For all you know you could be staring at that freaky 3-D maze screen saver with a blank look on your face while you THINK you're reading an inhumanly long text. For all you know, you could be halucinating my entire site! For that matter, how do you know that ANYTHING but you exists! You could be floating out in empty space, conjuring nice little fantasies to relieve the monotony of being the only living being! Every single person you know could just be figments of your imagination, you could even be in a crazy house! Not only that, but how do you know that YOU actually exist? You could be the figment of someone else's dream. What would happen when that dreamer woke? Are you happy? You got me started. I may NEVER shut up. I'll just go on and on about how crazy you COULD be. All because YOU tried to convince me that I was crazy. *blinks* And I STILL can't remember what else I was gonna say to you people. Strange, huh? Well, I better leave before I go on and on about more "reality" theories. Makes you wonder about "reality" television, huh? Seeya. I'm back. Grrrr...I had a nifty rant all planned out in my head. And then I was unable to get on the computer and I forgot most of it. Oh, but I did remember what else I wanted to say to you people. Remember that rant I did on how there could be a secret camera in the smoke detector? I few months ago I saw a movie about that. It was pretty good. Maybe I'd seen it before, and that's where I got the idea. I forgot it's name. Well...I DO have a special treat for you weirdos who apparantly like wasting time! Today, in my (Honors) English class, we did group work. My group...well...we either went hysterical or crazy, I can't decide which. We had to do an essay on a book. There was a sample essay online. It sucked. It tooked about envelooping (enveloping) cracked nuts and parables. So we were already off to a bad start. Here is the sum total of my group's work. (Note: I wrote virtually none of this, so I cannot be blamed, credited with any of this. "Lots of death, lots and lots of death in this section. Death is like life in that after you die some things start life again inside of you. 'Ah the power of cheese!' The author's vision was unique in that only he put biscuits and death in the same sentence. 'I found nothing else to do but to offer him on of my good Swede's ship's biscuits I had in my pocket'" And we're supposed to be GOOD in English! We KNEW how terrible it was, but we just didn't bother to change it. Especially the part about the biscuits and cheese. We just picked random words in the selection and wrote about them. It was sad. In any case, I hope you enjoyed our patheticness. Seeya! I'm back. Today I will be mercifully brief. I am here to bring AWARNESS to your moosey soul! Right now, while you are sitting in your "chair" and eating your "junk food", millions of almonds are commiting suicide. Yes...that's right...suicide. I was alerted to this growing problem in our world community by (Kat, the ruler of all that is almondy)...and it greatly concerns me. People just don't realize that their almonds and mixed nuts may be having depression and other problems. We need to act now! For more information, e-mail EnpuUnknown@msn.com Well...seeya! I'm so very, very tired. Today was Halloween. I worked for four hours at the "Library of Terror" sponsered by TAB. TAB members got pizza...lots of pizza...and candy. Ugh. It was fun, but exhausting. I was almost completly covered in (fake) blood...it was sticky toward the end. One guy was a "shock therepy" patient...he was a good actor. He acted like he was really being tortured and stuff. I'm tired. I bet you couldn't tell. Why am I writing? Because this is the first time I've been on a computer all day. You can't blame me. Don't worry, I'll go to bed soon. In the mean time, I'll just sit here and type with my eyes closed. It's hard to type because of the bandaid on my finger. I accidently cut it with scizzors. It hurt. The fake blood seeped into the open wound. Gee...I sure hope it wasn't poisonous. If so, I guess I won't be writing here for quite awhile...seeya. Okay, this next rant has nothing to do whatsoever with Halloween...which is to be expected because it's been several days since then. Anyway, today's rant is about one of my many and various pet peeves: fasion and...stuff. My definition of fasion includes clothes, shoes, jewelery and all things of that nature. Now, don't get me wrong. I can appreciate a spiffy black outfit as much as the next person, but everytime I consider actually buying clothes for aesthetic value, I think about how I could better spend my money. On video games. Sure, some of this "fasion" stuff is cool and all, but all it shows is that you had the three and three-quarters brain cells required to copy someone else's "look". And don't even get me started on earrings. My little, eviler sister got her ears pierced when she was relativly younger. My mom did it to her because it was free. OF FREAKIN' COURSE IT WAS FREE! Just like thos so called "diet supplements" that give you a "free" sample because they know that once you try it, you'll like it so much you'll spend oodles of cash on it. (There's probably drugs in it). Anyway, like the "diet supplement" people, the earring manufacturers KNOW that once they pierce you, you'll be hooked for life. *pauses* *groans* I'm sorry for that pun (pierced, hooked, getit?). AS soon as you're pierced, you have to buy "starter" earrings. Then you'll need an "extra" pair...for special occasions. Before you know it you'll realize that you need Christmas earrings, Halloween earrings, Valentine's Day earrings, St. Patrick's Day earrings, for crying out loud! You'll wear these "festive" earings for about a day and then abandon them in some dark cranny of your closet because you simply can't wear the same earrings two years in a row for heaven's sake! Then you'll see these cute little "days-of-the-week" earrings at the mall, and you'll just have to get a few sets, just in case you lose some. By the time you're eighty, you'll have enough ear jewelry to open up your own jewelry shop. Of course, you won't want to do that becuase you still need more earrings so people won't think you wear the same ones over and over again. When I think of how much money people WASTE on appearences, it makes me feel like projectile vomiting. If that's not a vast conspiracy, then nothing on this Earth is. Now, I'm not speaking from personal experience here. No one I know is that obsessed with earrings, it was just an example. (Although my mother does have a "earring tree".) Sure, certain members of my family do pay WAY to much attention to fasion, but that's just because of the expectations of society. I, being weird, am pretty much immune to such expectations. Except those specially formulated for weird-o's like me. If I were to suddenly convert this entrie site into a *shudders* Backstreet Boys fan site or something, you wouldn't be any more suprised than I would be if my brother woke up one day and suddenly realized that he's shallow. It's the same concept. (No, I don't like any of those creepy "pop" stars. I think that they should routinly die a slow, savage, agonizing death...I was just saying a random thing that I would never, ever do.) Well...any way...seeya! I'm back. And today's rant is a sort of philosophical one. It's about the (supposedly) infinite nature of the universe. Suprised? It's spiffy. You see, if the universe is indeed infinite, that means that literally EVERYTHING is possible, and in fact, is happening somewhere in the universe. Think about it. No matter how unlikely something is, if the universe is infinite, it's happening an infinite number of times. Think about that old saying about "If you gave an infinite number of monkeys an infinite number of typewriters, eventually they would reproduce the entire works of Shakespear". That makes complete and total sense! Anyone just randomly typing letters will eventually accidently write a word, right? Now think of 100 people typing randomly. You figure that one of those 100 people would actually have a coherent phrase. And one out of a million people would probably have a few sentences. So if you have an infinite number of people, some are going to have entire books of coherent stuff. And, you have to remember that because infinity is infinite, you can divide it an infinite number of times. Try it. If you have a decent graphing calculator, plug in the infinity symbol divided by anything, (even infinity). The answer is still infinity. Using my philosopy, that EVERYTHING exists because the universe is infinite...well...think about it. In some far off world, there are pokemon...there are an evil race of muffin like creatures, there is a world with ABSOLUTLY NO COMMERCIALS DURING TELEVISION! I know, unlikely, huh? But somewhere, it exists. Think about it. If the universe is infinite it would be crazy to think that we're alone. With an infinite universe, there are infinite possibilites. There ARE aliens. Not only that, but there are an infinite number of different kinds of intelligent life. Which means that there are an infinite number of worlds with humanoid life. (Think of the fake-looking Star Trek aliens). If there are an infinte number of worlds with human life, than there are an infinte number of worlds that have someone exactly like you, with only a few key differences. (Like alternate dimensions and stuff) So, there is a world where you are the creator of this Longest Text Ever. There is a world where you are a faerie. There is a world where you were never born. There is a world where you are a slave to your TOASTER OVEN. The possibilities are literally endless. Every fantasy the human mind has concieved exist at some place in the universe. There are an infinite number of worlds with Harry Potter. Think about it. I came up with this philosophy when I was in fifth grade. I'd tell it to my little brother as a bed time story. He always enjoyed it because it meant that somewhere, he was the Supreme Dictator of the Galaxy. That made him happy. He ignored the fact that he was also a 72 year old "sanitation engineer" somewhere. All the good possibilities effectivly cancel out the bad ones, leaving the sum total of you and your counterparts experiences as nothing. You don't have the best life of your counterparts, but you don't have the worst either. Because that would be impossible. There is always someone worse off and better off than you. Because there are an infinite number of people on either side of the spectrum. Confusing, huh? But that's the kind of thing I like. That also explains why normal stuff confuses me. I'm sure some so called "scientist" can prove all my theories wrong...but how? How do you PROVE something is not infinite? You'd have to find the end, of course. But how, may I ask, can you find the end of the FREAKIN' universe? What, is there a giant sign saying, "DEAD END"? The universe is EVERYTHING, how can it end? At the same time, how can you prove something IS infinite? You could travel in a straight line at the speed of light for a million years and all you'd prove is that the universe is really, really big. But you'd never prove it was infinite. How could you? Our mind's cannot conceive of the vastness of infinity. We'd probably go crazier. In any case, my theory means that playing video games is very cruel. Why, you ask? Because in some world, the video game is real. So when you kill, or whatever, in the game, you are actually ending life somewhere in the universe. Of course, you also end life by sneezing, eating, sleeping, and watching T.V. According to my theory that everything is real. Of course, if everything is real...then the Universe is pretty contradictory. The paradox of my system of beliefs leads me to believe that the universe, in fact, is not infinite. Because nature supposidly abhors a paradox. Although, as I said, there's no way to prove me wrong OR right. That's what I like about making abstract theories... Anyway, sorry for the lack of relative weirdness, conspiracy theories and doughnuts (my Moose ate them all). Well...now that I think about it...according to my theory, ALL conspiracies are real and mislabled "paranoid" people are really the only ones who see the truth. *blinks* Wow...so I'm NOT paranoid. Who'da thought it? Well...better go before one of my two and half sane readers falls asleep:) Seeya! I'm back! Boy, are you mythical, mystical readers in for a treat, today! I have a guest rant/fake commercial written by "Meg" (who is once again banned from accessing the almighty Internet). Are you ready? No? Too Bad! The magic eight-ball glows with knowledge! With a shake, the future is revealed! The magic eight-ball is a plastic casing with an unknown, possibly toxic liquid inside. The future is determined by the triangles, in a startling blue color which spin around in a zany manner. Wheather you're saved or doomed, find out now! Is that old lady on the street corner really an ex-convict? Is fat-free food more delicious than food loaded with fat? Is your school playground a gateay to the underworld? All this information and more is yours for the low, low price of 5 payments of $29.99! And, if you call within the next ten minutes you get a free eight ball with the one you buy! But wait! There's more! Get the free Lil' Ball for your traveling needs! Warning: this product is illegal in most states) Wasn't that entertaining? "Meg" wrote it for a school assignment. We were supposed to write about a cherished child-hood toy, and attempt to turn our fond memories into a commercial. I wrote about furby, and how it was fun to watch it die. No, really. Somehow, I managed to make my furby die. It would sneeze, then start it's eight-hour-long death hum. It would hum, and hum, and hum...and then mercifully die. I don't exactly have a good track record with virtual pets. I once...*embarassed pause* had "Hey, You! Pikachu!"...a pokemon game. I'll only say that it was the first game you could "talk" to and was the first (and only) N64 virtual pet. Pikachu...well...he didn't like me. I gave him cupcakes, and presents, and did everything I could to befriend him! And what did he do to me? He snuck up on me one day in our room (in the game) with a sword! That's right, a sword! He tried to kill me! I heard something and turned around, and there he was! He even tried to hide the sword behind his back! When I tried to talk to him, he tossed it away nonchalantly and pretended he hadn't heard me. Then he preceeded to trash my room, scattering kleenex everywhere. I'm pretty sure that the "smelly yellow ball" that he started throwing was his own feces (poo). That dirty little rat. Awwww...isn't he cute? Hmmmm...I suppose I should clarify that the Pikachu game was 3-D and your character was in first person mode(you see through character's eyes). Otherwise you'd think I was delusional, or something. Everyone I know who has played that game is shocked when I tell them...oh, well. Speaking of virtual pets, I'm revamping the ones on this site. I've finnally figured out sorta, maybe, kinda, how to do stuff to make it more real. Anyway, seeya! OOooooo! I'm back, and I had yet another Asparagus War with some people. We made a guild, and I wrote out the transcripts of the first ever Asparagus War in narrative form (mock epic, very cheesey) Since it's very, very long, I'll post it here to meet my imaginary word quota for the day! Oh, and all those weird squiggly lines and symbols, those are supposed to be apostrophes, but neopet's code is weird, and I'm not gonna bother to edit it. Enjoy! And, on the 15th day of the Month of August, in the year of our Lord 2003, at approximately 7:52 p.m. a great and wondrous battle was fought in the waste lands of the General Chat Room. â€˜Lo, and eon337 did wield the mighty Swiss-Asparagus, and did attempt to vanquish her foe, the Evil and Fluffy preggypreggy. Preggypreggy had tamed the fearsome Asparagus Sword, and many a foe had she slain with her valor. But behold! For the Swiss-Asparagus did slice, and dice and was capable of turning itself into julienne fries! And so it seemed that the two mighty warriors were evenly matched and that their struggle would never come to and end. They didst charge at each other with a terrible noise and clamor, and the skies did shake and the earth did tremble at the ferocity of their mighty blows! The stereotypical Asparagus Sword didst fail to hit its mark and eon337 did mock the Sword for itâ€™s falling. Translation: On 8-15-03, 7:52 NST, eon337 and preggypreggy grabbed some Asparagus Themed weapons and fought. They made fun of each otherâ€™s weapons, and generally kept missing each other every time they swung. And eon337 did think long and ponderous and in so doing converted the puny Swiss-Asparagus into the mighty and powerful toothpick. And the masses did gleam the significance of this act and they were awed by the grace and cunning of the wooden speck. And preggypreggy was immune to the verbal slings and arrows of her foe, and refused to be disheartened by eon337â€™s dishonorable insults. Her claim being that function of a weapon is to be put before the ornate form. She endeavored to thwart eon337â€™s plans to defeat her with the great and wondrous toothpick. She didst again pummel the air with her sword, but in her enthusiasm her blows didst fall far from their mark. And the masses didst cheer for eon337 as she had impressed them greatly and they made the sounds of impressive wonder. Translation: Eon337 turned a perfectly good Swiss-Asparagus into a toothpick to gain the approval of the studio audience. The audience oooed and awed. Preggypreggy continued to swing wildly around, missing each time. She ignored eon337â€™s insult and said that at least her sword worked. And then a new challenger didst arrive at the arena and scoobychick6900 didst fling bowls of asparagus at the fighting mortal enemies. Preggypreggy appealed to the masses, but to no avail, and was heartily surprised when the asparagus did hit her. And â€˜Lo! The masses didst condemn scoobychick6900 loudly and vehemently and there was much rejoicing in the land. Preggypreggy didst fancy that she had perhaps met scoobychick6900 previously, and so did attempt to recollect when. Eon337 did take advantage of the lull in action and did attack preggypreggy with her finger. Preggypreggy did retaliate with the awe-inspiring SuperPoke, and eon337 was laid low upon the ground in agony. Translation: Scoobychick6900 showed up and threw bowls of asparagus. Eon337 poked preggypreggy, and preggypreggy poked back, harder. Eon337 was hurt. And with victory in her mighty vision, preggypreggy didst decide to reveal her secret weapon, and with a fancy hand movement, revealed the extent of her traitorous ways. For all know that the bagels and the doughnuts didst disband in ancient times of old. Preggypreggy, through her treacherous methods, had obtained the Flying Doughnut of Doom and didst endeavor to use it. Eon337 was readily prepared for such an occurrence and didst arm herself with mighty ear-shields, armor that didst repel all projectiles of metal, a head covering, and an outer covering of strange, transparent material that didst snap whence it was squeezed. Aragorns_cutie then didst show up with the almighty nemesis broccoli and an unnecessary sneer upon her countenance. _Radical_girl_ did break the protocol and didst claim to rather fight with cucumbers, and so it was done. And the masses rejoiced. And eon337 didst not hear the newcomers because of her mighty ear-shields, and didst offer the fighters dressings for their wounds. Translation: Preggypreggy revealed that she had a secret weapon from Ancient Times, although eon337 was prepared for it, with earmuffs, bulletproof armor, and bubble wrap. Two new fighters showed up and did random things. Eon337 offered Band-Aids. And aragorns_cutie didst laugh in a manic way, and didst wave the broccoli to and fro in a threatening manner. And eon337 did finally recognize the newcomers, and ask, neigh, commanded they give preggypreggy healing strips. And _radical_girl_ didst howl furiously and implored the fighters to meet their DOOOOOOOOM. And so hiamplidude didst come to the battle and didst posses the almighty Asparagus Cannon, and did thinkest himself invincible. Following himaplidude camst nemmisis_dude, who didst offer the warriors ponderous messages such as: THIS TRULY WORKS! POST THIS IN 10 DIFFERENT BOARDS AND YOU WILL FIND A BABY PAINTBRUSH WHEN YOU GO TO CHAT PREFERENCE AND 10000000000NPS! THIS TRULY WORKS, TRUST ME. And the warriors didst consider nemmisis_dude a profit, who was devoted to speaking in tongues so as to convey a message from the gods. And â€˜Lo! Nemmisis_dude didst reveal his Bow and Asparagus and the masses rejoiced. And eon337 didst intimidate her foes by snapping her transparent covering and shrieking that she was invincible. Translation: Random stuff happened, and more people showed up. Someone spammed the message board so people ignored it and eon337 went crazier And â€˜Lo! The writer of this cheesy epic didst realize that virtually every sentence begins with â€œandâ€, and the masses rejoiced. _radical_girl_ didsâ€™t chase random people with her broccolis, and didst miss in her mighty swings. Hiamplidude didst take out nemmisis_dude, and gloried in his honor and didst receive a spinach gun from the gods. . Preggypreggy was threatened by the randomness, and didst call her secret weapon, the Mighty Evil Flying Donut Of Doom! Eon337 realized preggypreggyâ€™s unprecedented treachery and didst cower in her impotence before one so Dark and Fluffy. And aragorns_cutie had ex-lax and _radical_girl_ didst covet invincibility and so did don a pool covering. Nemmisis_dude was revealed to be unharmed by hiamplidude, and didst fire at preggypreggy with an asparagus gun. But preggypreggy didst forget one thing: eon337 still possessed the support of the ignorant masses, which guaranteed her inevitable victory. And preggpreggy scoffed at eon337â€™s supposed advantage and didst claim that even the ravenous horde of the people didst not conceive of her one vulnerable point. And preggypreggy didst close her mind to the truth: the dark side is fluffy. Translation: Preggypreggy called the Flying Donut of doom and eon337 called preggypreggy a traitor. The newcomers did random tings, and eon337 reminded everyone that she still had the support of the studio audience. Preggypreggy refused to see it as an advantage, and refused to believe that she was on the Dark, Fluffier Side. And behold, for eon337 didst transform the Asparagus Toothpick into a Aspara-Launcher and didst call preggypreggy deceived in her way of thinking, for the Dark Side is always Fluffier. And preggypreggy didst call forth the creamed cheese from the bowels of the Evil Flying Donut of Doom and the masses did rejoice, and wallowed in the fattening substances that fell from the air like a gift of mana from the gods. And eon337 didst fire projectiles at preggypreggy and unexpectedly mimicked the holy Matrix in her cries of â€œDodge thisâ€. And neoshadow08 didst arrive and inquire as to whether rubber chickens were allowed, and the multitudes said yes. Preggypreggy, in her infinite wisdom, failed to see the connection between Darkness and Fluffiness, and was so forsaken by the masses. And greyratt didst claim to have invented a new, spookier type of asparagus that never caught on, and the multitudes rejoiced. Preggypreggy didst dodge the projectile, and gained honor amongst the masses. As the theological debate about the Dark, Fluffier Side raged on, the newcomers fought with the dung of dogs, the chickens of rubber and other such unorthodox weaponry as greyratt didst play with discarded asparagus. Translation: Some stuff happened here. No, really! Eon337â€™s toothpick became an Aspara-Launcher, and preggypreggy and eon337 argued about whether the Dark Side was Fluffy or not. Neoshadow08 and greyratt came, and did stuff. Preggypreggy released cream cheese from the Flying Donut of Doom. And eon337 didst revealth that she didst posses the Ultimate Asparagus Themed Weapon, too terrible to be named, oh, what the heckth, the name didst ring and was The Thermo-Asparagus-Nuclear-Weapon. And preggypreggy didst begin to crack under the strain of the Squeak of Death, and so in his infinite understanding, neoshadow08 didst remove the Squeak of Death and didst replace it with the Chic Attack. Aragorns_cutie didst protest the violence, and didst consume the flavorful tomato paste. And moonbeam998 didst come, a magical priestess full of arcane knowledge. Her mighty glance didst fall upon the warriors and she didst proclaim: THIS TRULY WORKS! POST THIS IN TEN DIFFERENT BOARDS AND YOU WILL FIND A BABY PAINTBRUSH WHEN YOU GO TO CHAT PREREFERENCE AND 10000000000NPS! THIS TRULY WORKS, TRUST ME! And the warriors were mystified by her meaning, but verily they didst decide that it meant for them to continue their holy battle, in the name of whatever great and mysterious god moonbeam998 didst represent. Scoobychick6900 didst return to pummel the warriors with bowels of asparagus, as in times of old. Translation: Eon337 got out the Thermal-Asparagus-Nuclear-Weapon, and neoshadow08 stopped squeaking and started the Chick Attack. Yet another person spammed the message board, and was equally ignored. Scoobychick6900 returned. And neoshadow08â€™s baby chickens didst fall unto the warriors from the sky, and didst pummel the brave fighters unmercifully. And scoobychick6900 didst offer to the warriors magical rainbow colored pellets, which she didst hurl at them forcefully with a gun. The magic pellets were then revealed to be the chickenâ€™s only weakness. And the warriors were locked in a deadly struggle, each using their unique methods and weapons. And the masses didst rejoice yet again. And then â€˜Lo! For preggypreggy was forced to valiantly flee the battlefield, and acceded the victory to eon337. And the masses looked confused. Eon337 didst admit that preggypreggy didst fight a valiant battle. Skuld815 didst arrive and didst proclaim the battle strange and didst fling M & Mâ€™s at the warriors. And scoobychick6900 didst proclaim that Rice Krispies were much more powerful than other weapons, and didst think that she was the only warrior left. She did wail with despair as she didst discover that eon337 remained in the land of the living. Translation: Neoshadow08 caused chickens to fall from the sky, and scoobychick6900 fired skittles at people. Preggypreggy had to leave, and skuld815 showed up. Scoobychick6900 thought she was the last fighter left, but was not. And eon337 and scoobychick6900 were locked in a deadly struggle, candy versus vegetables. And neoshadow08 didst summon the Great Banana for advice, and the masses were stunned. Oh, the ground did shake, and the mountains trembled. The very stars became irregular in their rotations. And so the Great Banana was called, and it was good. And scoobychick6900 revealed that she had indeed blasphemed against the Great Banana and she didst quake in terror and attempted to corrupt eon337 into blaspheming as well. And shadow9441414 didst arrive with two prodigious asparagus swords. And spicychibie didst arrive and was proven to be crazier than all others, and the masses were impressed. Behold! Eon337 didst prostrate herself before the might of the Great Banana and didst beg for his aid in defeating scoobychick6900, and the Great Banana didst forgive eon337 and giveth her a banana. And spicychibie didst partake of the asparagus and didst faint. And the Great Banana didst advise eon337 to not rely on the strength of others, but to rely on the strength within. And scoobychick6900 didst appeal to the Great Banana and didst beg for forgiveness. And the Great Banana didst not make a reply, but instead didst close his eyes and did a perfect mimicry of sleep. And scoobychick6900 didst blasphemy again and didst explode bombs of rainbow color. And eon37, in the callow impatience of youth, didst detonate the Thermal-Asparagus-Nuclear-Weapon. And the masses were blown away. As the smoke, and rubble and debris were dissipated, behold! The Great Banana was vanquished! And eon337 didst lament this fate, for her weapon hadst been aimed at scoobychick6900. And scoobychick6900 didst revel in the defeat of the Great Banana, and didst stab at eon337 with its decapitated stem. And neoshadow08 was forced to choose sides, and â€˜Lo he choose eon337! And the warriors didst depart, if not friends, then less angry enemies. And so ends the first of: The Asparagus Wars Chronicles. Translation: While eon337 and scoobychick6900 fought, neoshadow08 called the Great Banana. Scoobychick6900 claimed to have eaten the banana the previous night, and feared the bananaâ€™s wrath. The Great Banana was defeated, and everyone decided that the war was over. Wasn't that entertaining? Seeya! I'm back! Woooooooooooo! Guess what? Yep! *happy wiggle dance* I gots the first shipment of the much needed (pictures of) supplies for the Official Flaming-Chickens Lunar Colony! Woooooo! I feels the happy! This has been a short announcment to document the happy wigglienss that is me. Seeya! I'm back. And vaguely depressed. For the longest time, random people have been coming to my site, and staying 0.00 seconds! How is this possible? Do they not even look at my site? How can they be so cruel, to click, but not look? Grrr.... I asked Santa why this was so...but he doesn't talk to me anymore, after that incident when I was a kid. You see...*start wavy flashback lines and dreamy music* When I was a kid...or whatever...I asked Santa for nuclear warheads, helicopters, tanks...and possibly legions of doom. No, seriously! (I was twelve and forced to communicate with Santa so that my younger siblings did not guess the truth...(what truth?)...there is no spoon. (badly done Matrix parody)) Anyway...Santa didn't come through. The creep! How was I supposed to conquer the world without those supplies? All I got was a Lion King video and other random stuff. How did this help me? I vowed revenge against Santa...after all, it would have benefited him to help me. Once I was the Undisputed Lord of the Universe, the world would have been a spooky place. And all the little children wouldn't have been "good" anymore, since they would be free of thier Authoritarian Parental Units and the definition of "good" (to a parent, at least) is to obey your parents and not embarrass them. Soooooo....Santa would have had it easier. No "good" children would have meant that Santa could have had a permanent vacation in the Bahahmas, not molested by my Legions of Doom because after all--he had delivered the world to me in a brightly wrapped gift box. The man would have been more trusted than my trusted Lieutenants! (funny word...had to use spell check to spell it ^^;;) But that jolly old IDIOT had to mess things up. So, to get back at him I not only continued to not believe in him, I attempted to convert all the miniony children at my disposal...(okay not really, the idea just occured to me)...so I ask you *cough* Loyal Reader, to immediatly cease believing in Santa. I figure that--like Tinkerbell--he will evenutally perish if he doesn't have enough people believing in him. What is this? You wish to rule the world, too? Well, you can't! It's mine! Blasphemy! You dare to challenge MY rule? You are a fool! Okay...yeah...my whole Santa plot IS kinda dumb...but that's just a front so that you never guess my REAL plot! That's right....cower before my power! *insert evil, insane cackle here* I shall defeat you, Anonymous (another tricky word) Reader! Gah! I'd better go before you trace my location thorugh the Internet and send your Governmental Spyders to me! Ooops...I gave you an idea, didn't I? Well, don't use it! It's mine, you are a copy cat! Seeya *appropriate evil glare* I'm back! And, seeying as you MUST be tired of MY ranting, I have a special treat for all you hypothetical two and a half readers out there! You get ranting from somebody else! I won't bother to introduce them, since they do a good job of it themselves...here we go: Hiya. This is not PSOPC today. This is PSOCB (Patron Saint of Carbonated Beverages). We are the two original Head Saints, but for some reason, she gets all the attention. Guess I should get out of bed once in a while huh. Originally, I thought up the whole Patron Saints of the Order of the Flaming Chicken (when I should have been taking notes in Trig), but PSOPC is more creative and she elaborated on it more so. I was drawing "suppressed rage in bunny form" comics then and didn't care. I must say, she's gotten very good at thinking randomy thoughts, whereas, I'm just stoopid and something dumb pops out of my brain like floppy bacon from a toaster. I drank half a bottle of soy sauce today just to see if it gave me x-ray vision, but alas, I had nothing I wanted to look through (okay, I'm lying. I drank the whole thing on a dare.). By the way, soy sauce is gross. Who invented it? --"Why gee whiz, Bert! I think we should mix soy beans with water and have chinese for lunch!!"--"Why, indubitoubly Samson! Not only will it taste like crap, we'll get the runs!!!"-- If you don't know what the "runs" are, consult old people, like my dad. If you are in high school or college and have a job, this works great. When I call in sick (when I'm sick of working, not actually sick), I always have nosey bosses who want to know exactly what my symptoms are and how bad. I found a way to make them not WANT to know. I told my sister to try it once and it worked for her too. You just call up work, use a very retarded, slow, lisping voice when you say this: --"Weeelllllllll, I woked up this mornin' with a terrible headache so I took some aspirin with theraflu. By the way, those don't mix too good, now I have a tummy ache, my nose is runny and bleedin', my spleen feels like its gonna 'splode, I'm a tad gassy, and I got the RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!-- At this point, you'll want to use an annoying high-pitched growly voice (think drunk Barney from The Simpsons after sucking helium balloons), raspberry a few times with your toungue and hang up. I have much to do now, so thus ends this portion of my guest rant. I'll probably want to do this a few more times just because I can. Weeee Bye now! I bet you, loyal *hmmm...I don't want a cricket...maybe a nice annoying gnat or something...okay...instead of the cricket...* readers can't wait for the next time I don't rant! Right? Weeeellll...I DO have a topic for today...a topic so wonderful that it will also be included in the next OFCEM! What is this magical topic, you ask? Why, opposite day, of course! You see...er...well...how should I begin? Opposite day is, of course a day in which everything you say means the exact opposite. It is practiced (informally) by many elementary schoolers. I honor this er...honored tradition. But, to my dismay, I discovered a fatal flaw with opposite day. By my reasoning...it COULD NOT EXIST! Yes...I know...blasphemy, right? But it could not be disputed. If you were to tell someone that it WAS opposite day they would have to take the opposite of what you just said which would mean that it WASN'T opposite day. And, of course, if you were to tell someone that it WASN'T opposite day there would be no reason for them to take the opposite of what you said and so it still WOULDN'T be opposite day! Confusing, huh? But I have now seen the light! The answer to this moral dilema has been so neatly resolved, by Jesse. He is er...well...I'm not sure how old...but he is in the third grade. He is either a genius...or really weird like me (Come on, be honest...how many of you random people have put any though into opposite day...or even know about it?) He said that to make it opposite day...*dramatic pause in which the PSOPC stares into space vacantly*...all you had to do was say that it would be opposite day in 5 seconds! PURE GENIUS! Since it is not yet opposite day, you don't have to take the opposite of the statement and so can take it at face value! Do you care, Loyal *gnat/cricket sound* Reader? *stunned* You don't!? Why ever not!? It is the most important discovery since...since...er...since...GRAVITY! (Although it is evil and squishying my spine...) How can you remain apathatic at a time like this!? The fate of mankind has been forever altered! Oh. Yeah...I guess you are right. I AM just rambling so that this Longest Text Ever gets even longer. But I DO care about this topic. There's not even a conspiracy! Well..fine! Be that way! Goodbye! I'm back *twitch* and seriously annoyed. Grrr...time to yet again complain about my *twitch* evil family. It is once again the time of year that makes entire families bond together...in the same sense that cats and dogs bond together when they have rabies. The time...is science fair time. My younger, eviler sister does a science project every single year. *twitch* The concept of science projects strikes fear in my mother's heart. She can not stand them. Naturally, this is why she takes over the project and does it for my little sister. Unfortunatly, this means that I am often called on for my "consultant" abilities. *twitch* In other words, I do the experiment, and think of all the results, and the wording of everything. I then interpret my work for my mother, who writes everything down because she has really, really obsessivly neat handwritting. Of course, my mother gets stressed merely handling paper that will potentionally be USED for a science project, so this is a very, very negative situation. Oh, and my mother refuses to even entertain the notion that my little sister might possibly be of help *twitch*. At this very moment my little sister is watching a Disney movie, while complaining of a headache. *twitch* My mother is getting more and more aggravated as I try to explain that my sister might fail if it looks like she didn't do the project. I am currently on strike. I refuse to assist this project in any further way untill my little sister does freakin' SOMETHING. Wow. Speak of the devil. My sister IS doing something. She is RE-WRITING everything my mother just wrote. Like mother like daughter. *twitch* I guess this is my mother's way to make sure the judges don't know that my sister didn't do the project. My mother makes my sister redo everything over and over again because it's not perfect enough for her. Now she is the one who's getting yelled at. I guess I can't help but feel sorry for my evil sister. *pauses* I guess I'll stop complaining, then. God...I have a headache...seeya. I'm back. *shakes head* And I have (yet again) a rant about the sheer weirdness of my family. Previously I have ranted about our fun-filled family outing to a bar, and about my non-gender specific siblings obsession with dead animals. Somehow, these two occurances have joined in an unholy union to create: The Roadkill Sightseeing Event of Doom! We actually went to a normal resteraunt for dinner, believe it or not. On the way back, my mother entertained us with the story of how she had seen roadkill that looked exactly like a dead bear. She had later compared notes with one of her wacko friends and they had decided that it was, in fact, a dead wild boar. We would be passing by it in a few minutes. Oh joy. My non-gender specific sibling (henceforth known as my sister) was naturally estatic about these events. She wanted to get out and see the boar. My mother agreed, and wanted my Dad to turn the car around so we could go to Wal-Mart to buy a flash-light. My father refused this. We ended up driving right past the supposed location of the boar, much to the dismay of my sister and mother...and dare I say it? Yes...I dare. My BROTHER was even interested. Faced with direct mutiny from all but me, my father wisely elected to turn the car around. We drove off the road and my dad aimed the car headlights at the boar. I must say, it wasn't that impressive. It was just a lump of black hair, and it was a lot smaller than any bear. My sister was impressed, and it was all I could do to keep her from jumping out of the car to it. My mother was disappointed, saying that the boar had seemed bigger in the daylight. My dad moved the car back and forth, so that we could see the boar on the side of the road more clearly. My mother became terrified and decided that we would flip and die. All to see a boar. After a few minutes, we drove away. My mother seemed upset that I had not been interested in her roadkill. I can't help but feel cheated. Normal families go to museums and theme parks for amusement. We view dead animals. There is something just SLIGHTLY wrong with this. It reminds me of the time a few weeks ago when my mother swore up and down that she saw a grave by the side of the road. This bothered her for some time untill one day she finally pulled over to the side of the road and exhumed the shallow grave and discovered that it was actually a deer. Luckily, I was not with her this day. However, she never leaves any member of our family in the dark concerning roadkill. It's just strange. Anyway, that's the rant for today, seeying as how there was actually a topic. Seeya! I'm back! Seeing how I will shortly no longer be (legally) a child, I have decided to rant about: adults. You cannot deny it. They are EVIL. Think about it! Come, on! Don't be shy! I'm serious. When you think of the evil, conniving, conspiratorial ways of adults, what's the first thing to come to mind? The nursery rhyme, 'Mary Had a Little Lamb', right? Huh? You mean it's NOT!? How...bizzare, it's obviously a mechanism for brain-washing. Anyway, here's MY reasoning for hating the song (and many, many others). Mary Had A Little Lamb makes children resigned to accepting punishment that they don't deserve! You still do not see!? Fine, I shall elaborate. This poor little girl's lamb (with fleece as white as snow--an obvious reference to seeming purity) follows her to school one day (which was, oddly enough, against the rules). The kids at school, who were not used to seeing a lamb at school, started to "laugh and play" and basically act like wild animals. Now (this is all speculation) I am 90% sure that the final verse (which neither I, nor anyone I asked know) deals with the teacher reprimanding poor little Mary in some way. And for what!? The kid's pet followed her to school! How could she stop it, she probably never even thought to look behind her! Not only that, but poor little Mary would never, EVER do such a thing on purpose! Just listen to the SONG for cryin' out loud! The lamb followed HER! She didn't LEAD it! Now, sure, the teacher was probably on her last nerve. I mean, she's an ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER. She probably doesn't get paid much, or gain much respect from her pupils. So, when the children pretty much went wild over the lamb, and she couldn't calm them, she was looking for someone to blame. And poor little Mary was a ripe target by then. Now, can you honestly picture poor little Mary arguing with her teacher? I didn't think so! Little Mary took her punishment, and her PARENTS were probably so upset that they got rid of her white little lamb. And for what!? A teacher's misbegotten pride? Adult supremecy? I ask you, knowing what you know now, could you (in good faith) read this to a young child (implicitly teaching them that it's best not to argue, to simply lie down and let those older than you walk all over you--for "your own good")? And another thing! You know the lullaby, 'Rock A'Bye Baby', the one about the baby in the tree!? What kind of SICKO wrote it!? This poor baby is up in a tree (not the safest of places) in the middle of a freakin' HURICANE! At the end of the freakin' song, the freakin' BRANCH BREAKS and the baby falls, "cradel and all" (presumably to its death). What about Hanzel and Gretel? It's nothing more than a huge threat! "Now, be good or we'll send you out into the woods to be eaten by the witch." What kind of twisted person does that to children? Ring Around the Rosy? It's a song about the Black Plague, the deadliest plague in mankind's history! When you first got it, you'd get a red spot with a ring around it (Ring around the rosy). During this time, people (mistakenly) thought that stench spread sickeness, so they'd keep "pockets full of posies" to ward of the stench of death around them. "Ashes, Ashes" was originall "Achoo-Achoo", because the dying would be particularly susceptable to colds. "We all fall down"? That's an easy one. We fall down dead. So, it's obvious that adults don't exactly sugar-coat everything they teach to children. I'm sure I can find more horribly EVIL examples, but I simply don't have the time. Now, granted, there are SOME (but not many) children's stories that are beneficial. Like Snow White, or Cinderlla. Those stories teach children to think for themselves, and occasionally completly ignore the adults around them (as long as they are Evil Step-Parents). Well...I'd better go. *blinks* I wrote a lot today. I suppose I should write other stuff...but...well...I figure you need the break to recover your sanity...*snort* Like you could do THAT! Seeya! I'm back! As I am writing this, I am in the process of adding a navigation bar to the Longest Text Ever. It still is as chaotic as ever, but at least this way people can find certain stuff easier. Like the Official Flaming-Chickens Lunar Colony info. Anyway, that's about all I have to say right now. Seeya! Gah! Fellow Flaming-Chickens, you must see the sheer cool paranoid thinking I have found! Wal-Mart is EVIL! A person (besides me) thinks this! Isn't that cool!? There is even a section on Wal-Mart Subliminal T.V. (tupperware, anyone?)! Anyway, this has been a short public service annoucement. As opposed to one of those long public service announcments that keep on going and going and going. I mean, they just never seem to stop, do they? Just when you think they are finally going to run out of steam, they just charge on and on. It's like torture, or something. Don't those kind of people realize that if they public REALLY cared about the topic, they'd do their own durn research, instead of listening to some self-important moron lecture them about how socially-irresponsible they are? Not that I'm trying to prove a point. Quite the contrary: I am merely extending the lenght of this Longest Text Ever to provide an ironic example of self-important morons who just won't stop talking. Isn't it entertaining? Don't you just want to here my entire life's story, starting from age 2? You don't? Well...perhaps I really SHOULD leave...what do you think? Er...well...seeya! Yep. I'm back. *traumatic pause* This weekend I went to go visit my future college. It was the most traumatizing experience of my life, to date. The day before I got there the college had won a basketball game and were going to the finals. This naturally caused parties to break out all over campus. According to one guy, a couch was "set on fire". *sigh* I was "hosted" (along with two other girls) by some bubbly, perky Greek (sorority (sp?)) girl. I hate her so much. She never shut up. She was so shallow. She wanted us to join a sorority, just like her. (all paraphrased) Ex. 1 "I would NEVER have passed my classes if I hadn't gone Greek". Ex. 2 "I just don't see HOW I would have, like, ya' know, managed ANYTHING without my sisters!" If I never see her again it will be too soon. Her idea of entertainment was to take us to the recreational center, sit us down in the gym and talk to her friends while watching the guys (badly, this IS an engineering school after all) attempt to play basketball. Apparantly all the decent players were at the final game thingy. Then she took us to the fraternity next to her house (we didn't even get to "experience" sleeping in an actual dorm). The fraternity was disgusting. There must have been 1000 flies, 100 beer bottles, 50 Bud Lite cans, and 5 creepy dudes who were attempting to practice music for some competition. After about three hours of this, I almost snapped. Me and another girl were supposed to be watching T.V., but due to the evil, out of tune, incredibly loud band, this proved to be impossible. My "host" and the girl who was enthusiastic about "going Greek" were swimming in a heated pool. The other girl (who also hated to swimn) and I started to talk. There was nothing else really to do. She hated our host and hated the fraternity/Greek thing too. We talked for awhile, and some dude joined us. He was cool. He was regional STAR student for another area. Somehow we got onto the topic of religion, and it turned out that the other girl I was with was Muslim, and was born in Egypt. It was cool. Anyway, it was just the two of us girls in the entire FREAKIN' fraternity (not counting the two swiming girls, downstairs. The floor was greasy, and oddly sticky--just like a movie theater. When our "host" finnally said we could go, it was close to 2 a.m. I barely got any sleep...grrr...not to mention the fact that we had walk to breakfast by 8:00 a.m. Oh. Silly me. I forgot to mention a key difficulty. We had to WALK EVERYWHERE! Uphill! (But not in the freezing snow, for 15 miles). You have not experinced Jenny's personal Hell untill you have carried your luggage (including a trash bag containing a sleeping back and the trash bags plastic handley-thingies are rapidly stretching out to become lethal weapons similar to piano wire) uphill, upstairs, across campus and up the four or five flights to the breakfast area, only to discover that, Oh! Gee, there was an ELEVATOR that the "host" conviently forgot to mention. Even more evil stuff happened, but suffice it to say that when I finally saw my dad at lunch, I begged him to just skip the final sessions because they were pointless (how to choose your major) and go home. He went ahead with his sessions, but let me opt out of mine and I slept for 50 minutes on some random couch in the lobby. Oh. And then the 6 hour drive home. *shudders* As you can tell, I am still seriously miffed about the whole experience. Sorry for ranting... Well...there WAS some good things about the whole experience. For one thing, it was the first time I'd ever been in a big city. The sky line was beautiful! Er...yeah...that was about it. Did I mention the uphill walking part? I did? Oh. Well. Then. I guess I'm done. Seeya! I'm back! And I'm here with a Vital Public Service Anouncment for all of my two and a half Loyal, Hypothetical Readers! Don't you feel all special inside? Oh. Yeah. The anouncment. BEWARE OF YOUR OWN FRENCH FRIES. That's correct. French fries. You see, it all started one friday afternoon *start wavy flashback sequence* My friends and I were sitting down to a tasty lunch of Skool Brand food. This included, tragically, french fries. Oh, what a fateful day. It seems like it was only yesterday when we were so carefree and innocent...when in fact it was actually only a few hours ago. You see, we inadvertantly started a mini-food fight that spilled over into a neighboring table, which also housed our friends. Said friends began flingning the aformentioned French Fries at us. I shudder to think of how we had laughed and frolicked and otherwise remained oblivious to the tragedy that had yet to unfold. For, you see...the french fires were...pointy...and hard. And Fate herself seemed to conspire against us (just like the Skool, government, evil cartoon owl, etc.) One single solitary french fry pierced my friend's guard and hit her on the nose with the sharpest, hardest tip a french fry has ever been known to produce. We calmed down, and thought nothing of our near brush with Death. After all, what can a FREAKIN' FRENCH FRY do, right? Ahhh...to be so young and naive again. Time passed, as it always does, and "Meg" noticed a speck of something on our friend who had been hit by the projectile french fry. The friend (Tonileigh, actually) wiped the speck, only to discover that it was blood. THE FRENCH FRY HAD DRAWN BLOOD! It was obviously an evil, voodoo french fry sent to assasinate her by the mysteriously evil Cafeteria Lunch Ladies who needed Tonileigh's blood for their accursed voodoo spells. Fortunatly, the quick thinking of "Meg" saved us all and the lunch ladies never obtained their goal. Oh. And here is yet ANOTHER VERY, VERY, VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC SERVICE THINGY. Tag, you're it! These words have haunted nearly ever playground in existance. "Tag" is practically all a child learns in kindergarten. There is not a person alive who has not played some version of the game. And yet...what, exactly is "it"? When defining it for my Pronoun Quiz I reffered to "it" as something that "mankind has dreaded for centuries". What made me say such a thing. What is it about the unknown, mysterious and faintly ominous "it" that makes people dread it so much? Even the most innocent of children know that to be "it" is to be a virtual outcast of society. The youngest child knows that no sane person would want to be "it". Recently a group of TAB members, myself included, set about finding out what "it" exactly is. We conducted "field research" (we played a game of tag). When I became "it" I declared that I was touching the bench I was standing on so it became "it" and the bench was touching the ground, and the ground was touching everything on earth, except for airplanes and stuff but even the ground was touching AIR which was touching more air and so on and so on untill the very AIR was touching the airplanes and the airplanes became "it". So...the entire earth has actually been "it" from the first game of tag and WE JUST NEVER KNEW IT! I know, I'm just as shocked as you, Hypothetical Reader. *shakes head* And all along we had thought that we could somehow absolve ourselves of the burden of being "it" simply by passing it on to another. But that is not true. We merely pass the awareness of being "it" on but never the actual quality of being "it". The question was raised: Where did the first "it" on Earth come from. It was a thought provoking question. Some thought that perhaps the first person to invent tag was the original "it". I, however, favored an extraterristrial origin. My current theory is that the meteor that supposidly killed off the dinosaurs was the original "it", and that it "tagged" the earth, thereby causeing the earth to be "it". The dinosaurs, of course, could not handle the burden of being "it" which resulted in mass suicides. The mammals, being nothing but idiot rodents at the time, couldn't care less about being "it" and eventually forgot all about it. Until, that is, some half-remembered special memory popped out of some five year old's brain and he/she invented tag. Some people found holes in my theory: How did the meteor become "it"? After much discussion and deliberation, we came to a group consensus that the so called "Big Bang" was actually all the players of the game scattering. Similar to the beggining of a game of tag or hide-n-go-seek. The players begin huddled together, but when the game starts they scatter and flee from the person/planet/rock who is "it". The only difference I can think of is that rather than passing the "it"ness on, the players merely add to the number of people who are already "it". My theory would also account for the current scientific opinion that the planets/galaxy/universe is moving away from the origin point of the Big Bang. After all, if there's no base, why return to where you started? You wanna put as much distance between you and your pursuers as possible. Critics wanted to go further, was anyone "it" BEFORE the Big Bang. My arguement is this: No one is "it" before you begin a game. Any "it" before the Big Bang was part a seperate game, and would therefore be considered a different "it" from the "it" that we fear so much. So I believe the question to be a moot point. *blinks* What's that, Loyal Reader? I have confused you with my trivalties? You do not understand my obsession with "it"? Shame on you, Reader! Haven't you learned yet that it's my JOB to confuse you and make no sense? Tsk-Tsk. Oh, well. Gotta go! I'm back, but only for about five seconds. Just a little side note here: Remember that rant I did about "pure" water? (don't even get me started) In it I mentioned that fast-food salt lists its ingredients, right? Well, here they are! *takes package of Burger King Iodized Salt out of pocket* Drumroll please...and the ingredients are: salt, sodium silico aluminate, dextrose, and 0.01% potassium iodide. Wasn't that painstakenly accurate? A hundreth of a percente of the salt was potassium iodide! You can't get much more accurate than that. Don't you think that "pure" water has much MORE than 0.01% of some random mineral? Why don't THEY list it, huh? *shakes head* *mutters* Evil, "pure" water companies... *wanders off muttering to self and acting like a crazy hobo* Seeya... I'm back! And I have yet another footnote to a previous rant! You remember that "infinite possibilities" rant? Here's a quote from a supposed Time Traveler: "Every possible thing that can happen or will happen has already happened somewhere." I love it! Here's another one: "On a philosophical level, the existence of multiple worlds implies a moral balance in the superverse. For every worldline you perform a good action, there is a worldline where you perform a bad action. There are no good and bad people, just good and bad decisions. We can only be responsible for what we do as individuals on the worldline we are on now. " These are all exactly what I've been thinking of when I first came up with my infinite universe thingy to tell my little brother when he was bored and wanted his head to explode! Seeya! I'm back. And I just wanted to say that I went to Islands of Adventure (in Universal Studios) yesterday. It was incredible! If you wanna here about the awesome rides, (esp. the Spiderman ride, best 3-d effects and vitual reality I've EVER seen...) just click here. *shrugs* This way, if you don't wanna here me rant about it, you can here some guy PAID to rant about it rant about. But if you don't want to, you don't got to. Seeya! I'm back! Wow...*shakes head* My mother never ceases to be amusing. Since today IS mother's day, I shall devot this text to her...even if it is a bit of satire or whatever. You see...my mother has found a new "religion". She is reading some book written by some bimbo who has been to "the other side" and conversed with her "spirt guardian" or whatever and decided to share her "relevations" with people willing to pay a lot of money for garbage. At least...that's my opinion of it. My mother, however, takes it all VERY seriously. For instance, today at our (almost normal) dinner out she instructed me on the way to get to heaven. It involved opening a door. Seriously. Anyway...apparantly once you perish in this realm you are taken to a set of doors. The door on the right leads directly to heaven (do not pass "Go" do not collect $200). The door on the left "zaps you into someone's uterus" which, loosely translated, means that you get reincarnated. This is the "bad" choice. I know this because my sister expressed an intrest in being reincarnated and my mother looked at her with an expression of horror and said solemnly that if she did that "God would never forgive" her. She then proceded to tell us that if you were reincarnated you had to live out multiple lives until you were ready for heaven. *shakes head* Maybe I'm missing something, but if "God would never forgive" someone who innocently chose the wrong freakin' door, wouldn't that indicate that such a person would be barred from heaven forever? Isn't there just the SLIGHTEST bit of inconsistancy here? Why would somebody get punished by randomly choosing the wrong (apparantly unlabeled) door? Look. I don't mean to offend...~.< If you happen to be part of this religion (which prophecies Elvis's return sometime this year (2004) as "a blond hair, blue-eyed boy") then that's your choice. I definitly don't want to get in any theological debates here. So...I'll move on the a relatively safer topic. The National Enquirer. They're obsessed with Elvis, too, for some reason. I just don't understand why people care. I mean, Elvis is always reported as being: abducted by aliens, frozen in a tube in Area 51, having a brain transplant and is now the Pop-Star Britney Spears, and stuff like that. One song I've heard even equates Elvis with Jesus, for cryin' out loud! ("You're no Jesus, You're no Elvis" (From Megolomaniac, by some band). Why do people obsess over that poor, most likely dead, man? The world may never know. ( And don't even get me started on Tootsie Roll Pops). Anyway, I guess my point is that the book my mom is reading has a similar dedication to accuracty, hard-hitting facts and common sense as the famed National Enquirer (which confidently predicted several months ago that Michael Jackson's "secret Muslim bride" would exonerate all charges of child molestation against him. Which, in case you live on the moon, has NOT happened and probably never will). Anyhoo, that's my rant for the day...I'll probably post something in l33t eventually...seeya! I am back. (REAL introduction: Heh-Heh…I had ANOTHER sugar rush. And I was just a little bit hysterical. The following is my intro I wrote while sugar rushed, and various messages I sent to people while in the same state. Don’t worry if you can’t understand it…you aren’t supposed to. *sigh* The whole thing is just a blur of those wiggly red lines spell-check uses to tell you that stuff is spelled wrong…) I back! hee-hee! here is ANother sugar coated rant! and I am typing the intro while still hyper/slepepy. you see, i drank Sobe energy drink, a cup of sugar (just sugar) and ate cake (yet agina, late at night). So this was the result in various messages I left random peolple.
*giigleing * Heee0-Heeeee! Sugar isf so very good1 and so is Sobe energy drink (sobe stands for 'soper'! *wavres hand* you see, i THOUGHT that i had recovered because i am no longler laughing so much! But, as you can see I do'nt think I'm am quite baCK TO normal. yet. whatever normal is... i am swayinhg to an imaginary breeze!@ and i don't care that i amn missplesling so many workds. because i am sure you will figure it wout someohow. il am very creative with words. do you like sugar? why DILD you get all freaky like me when i ate suo much sugart. ? zI vcan'y believe that we actually did that to thos e magazines...we so stupid. erm...ummmmm...i sure do hope we remember all of this. don't forget: we owe the library $4 each. That was all spel;ed coirecltly because it was important. i want to sleep now. but ever ei nlsince i ate that cup of sugrar it is to tired t o sleep. imagineation that. er jd f....er...eum...ye ah. *scurnches up eyebrows* Heh-Heh...the Song of Solumnun. good wuvs EVERYBODY! those incompetent physics/stupid rays must have really hit ius hard! either (say it so it rhymes with neither )with an long "I" sound)) that or we were jhust especially suseptible to the thing-a-ma-bnobober.s will wyou right me cback? i hope so. it'll be especially great if you right me when you are all sugary, too. who says you need drugs or thwatherver to have fun? sugar is very cheap, and makes everything so very, very funhy. *slams hand on tasble* OUch. That hurnt . Iam still wet from the watergun fight. It rocked! All that shorrtting and stuff! I got so many head-shots...er...can your brother see yet? I'm sorry i hit his eyes...dozens of times in a row. It was just so fun! we should do that somethimg again. you guys weren't taking it very seriously , though... *snickers* Hee-kheee...funny stuff. I ate a CUP of sugar. mmmm...sugar...I wis swaying in the place. Sugar and me, we don't g et along so well since I react to it like most people react to beingg drunk or under the ijnnnclunce of other suttff. Oh, god...sugar. i'm gonnat add another sugar rant to the longest text ever (just two ever)!sand for people who dont' know me...know,...i do k not do stuff. It's just that sugar under the wright surcumstances is doin' stuff...
Okay. Is done. Mike the Headlessc hickrn day is coming up! seeya later! I'm back. It has been a year since the Evil Graduation Post. Which means that this year I got to attend my OWN graduation. Woo. I must say that I was rather underwhelemed by the whole thing. *shrugs* Sure, the fireworks were spectacular...and there was BEAUTIFUL weather. Cool, (not sufficatingly hot) absolutly no gnats for the first time in YEARS, no rain, just nice, soothing speeches that made absolulty no sense. At one point, our priniciple yelled at the graduating class because we weren't listening to him. The audience (consisting of parents) booed at him. So the principal yells at the PARENTS! What was he THINKING!? It's a good thing he's leaving, soon, because otherwise he'd probably been fired. Anyway, I just wanted to warn you of the dangers of broccolii: It's a form of lichen/moss that grows abundantly on certain sectors of Mars. In recent years, it has been cultivated by farmers into a semi-toxic product meant to augment the on-going brain-washing of young children, with the sole purpose being to turn them into Young Adults. Seeya! I'm back. I'm just gonna be here for a little while *demonstrates with fingers* so you don't have to worry 'bout crazy, paranoid rants. I just wanted to mention that former President Reagan apparantly declared ketchup to be a vegetable. Isn't that GREAT! I love ketchup so much...I don't even like FRIES...I eat 'em 'cause they are a means to convey KETCHUP to my mouth...mmmm....ketchup. Oh. Poor, poor Reagan ( he died last week...) Hasta Luego (means seeya later) I'm back. *sigh* This dang chatterbot is taking up WAY too much of my time! There's constantly things that needed fixing, updating and improving! Bah! But, I'm obsessed, and I've always been interested in simulated artificial intelligence :) Anyway, I'm making her personality really paranoid (she's based on me). Here are her thoughts concerning cows: *glances around* Just between you and me: I think there is some sort of dairy conspiracy! Ah, the power of cheese! Think about it: they are trying to sub-consciously tell you that THEY hold the power...of CHEEESE! And there are few things more powerful than THAT! Plus, the so-called "dairy farmer's of America" who pay for the Cheese commercials OBVIOUSLY have a virtual monopoly on the whole dairy thing. They even require that cheese get that little "real cheese" stamp before anyone considers it to be REAL cheese. Have you ever tasted fake cheese? Anyway, my point is that it is getting increasingly harder to find the time to make new quizzes, (or add pics to that destiny quiz), and to make coherent entries into this longest text ever. *sniffle* I try, though! It's just that it's so FUN to teach PSOPC bot subtle things, that maybe one in every 1000 visitor will stumble on to! Like, when she accuses you of being on of THEM, and you say "yes" she starts to panic, and won't listen to you unless you say somthing to get her attention. Ahhhhhhh. Well, anyway, enough about my little obsession. No sense in boring you all with the little technicall details (frankly, pandorabots has the training interface done really well...there is almost no need to know ANYTHING about programming...which, frankly...I don't...^^;;) Er....I guess that's all I have to say now...I don't really have much more parnoid conspiracies or strange observations to make. Er...I guess I could discuss something that has already become obsolete. Have you ever been to subway? You have, *nods* yeah...I love that place, too. Anywaaaays, I went there once and I noticed a poster in the window. It showed people of every size, shape and color, all of them in little pics in little neat boxes. The text read: Different People Differnt Tastes. Okay. I could easily see what it was TRYING to say: There is something for EVERYONE at Subway (eat fresh). But my very first thought was: Whoa, hey, are they CANNIBALS!? Because I interpretted it to mean that different people TASTED differnt, and that's what the subs were made out of and why there was such a great variety. Er...I know, Hypothetical Reader...not the best example of my eccentric thought proccess...but it's the first one that came to mind. *sigh* You know, come to think of it, I bet I HAVE dwindled back down to two and half readers (if that). After all...look how LONG this thing is getting! And, well, quite frankly, people are mostly contacting me about PSOPC bot, the OFCEM or the Quizzes, and *sniffle* mostly ignoring this little (note the irony) page. Well, seey later! I'm back. And, for the first time in quite some time, I am truly pissed off...and this is the only way I can vent my anger. Gah! Well, I suppose you'll need to know some back story, huh. (WARNING: CONTENTS OF THIS PASSAGE MAY CONTAIN DANGEROUSLY LOW LEVELS OF HUMOR, IRONY AND SARCASM. READING THIS PASSAGE MAY CAUSE THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS: LACK OF INTEREST, BOREDOM AND A GENERAL SENSE THAT THIS IS NOT LIKE NORMAL RANTS ABOUT PARANOIA, STRANGE OBSERVATIONS AND FAMILY QUIRKS) To begin with, I JUST got a job as a cashier slave at K-Mart. NEVERMIND the fact that I've worked at the daycare for A WHOLE YEAR, just so I wouldn't have to work for my final Summer of Freedom. Apparantly, my dad does not want me to actually USE any of the money I made from my previous job to buy college supplies. Instead, he wants me to learn the horrors of minimum wage employment and induce me to to strive to succede in the college world. NEVERMIND the fact that my previous job gave me LESS money...I apparantly STILL need to understand that there is more to life than $5.50 an hour. GAH! I KNEW that most jobs sucked unless you had a degree (and even then, most STILL sucked)! Why bother to teach me THE SAME FREAKIN' LESSON AGAIN!? Eh. I didn't argue, mostly 'cause my dad IS paying for most of the college expenses...so I am grateful. I just hate K-Mart. So...today was my biggest shift ever, from 3 pm to 8 pm. It's the latest I've ever worked, too. I know it's NOTHING compared to a full time job...but it's still enough to make me snap. FIRST OF ALL...well...there weren't a lot of customers during the first half of my shift. Blessing, or horrible boredom? In either case, I managed to obtain a Bag of Air from a purse someone bought, and (true to form) instead of discarding said air bag, I drew a face on it and decided that it was my pet, Bag. Oh, me and Bag had great times. I taught Bag how to return (I threw him at a fan and he blew into my face). I introduced Bag to a customer I knew (after they left and I was alone, even I knew that talking to a Bag is weird). *sigh* I hugged and squeezed Bag harder than I have ever squeezed a Moose, because I knew that Bag didn't have stuff like organs. The worst that could have happened that he would have exploded in my face, blinding me forever. Ahhhhh...Bag. Then...*sniffle* tragedy struck. I left my register to get something to restock the candy...and when I came back...Bag was missing! Frantic, I looked around, and saw, before my very eyes, a fellow cashier puncture my precious Bag with a key! They had thought that Bag was garbage! I had customers and so I had to deal with them, with a false smile plastered painfully on my face, while all the while I was repeating over and over the horrible scene. Once the customers left (after what seemed like an eternity) I rushed over to wear I had seen Bag. He wasn't there. I looked in the garbage can...he wasn't there. I looked in some nearby boxes...he wasn't there. I couldn't ASK the other cashier what she had done with Bag...no one at K-Mart knows my true weird nature yet. So...I regretfully had to forego giving Bag his needed funeral respects. We had some good times together...and we had JUST started to bond when his life was ended. I knew that it would happen, eventually. Even if I had managed to bring him home, I would eventually have lost interest. Bag was the perfect companion for my boring hour and a half. But Bag was no more. As the time dragged on, more and more customers came. During the last hour, the customers started to dwindle off (cool word, huh...dwindle...say it! Dwiiiiiindle...) I was once again left bored. I eventually grabbed a piece of cardboard (hmmmm...that came discarded from a bag I sold, too...coincidence? I think not!) and started to draw a cute little bunny and a tiger...(GAH! I think I left that at the register...I bet that EVIL other cashier is throwing it away, right NOW!). I was able to draw in peace for a while, with only the most minor of customer interruptions. Then...the other Cashier went on her brake. We are allowed 15 minutes for our breaks. She went 17 minutes before I my shift was over. Can you guess what happened? *sigh* I HAD been planning to close up shop at about 7:53 and clock out on TIME for once ( I usually close when I'm supposed to leave and end up clocking out 5 minutes after). So...I am looking forward to doing a little shopping (for hand-held Nerf guns) before my parental unit came to pick me up. So, predict, if you will, what happend exactly 10 mintues before I was going to close. You can't? Well...let me tell you: EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE STORE APPARANTLY DECIDED THAT IT WAS TIME FOR THEM TO LEAVE. Not all at once, oh, no, they were more subtle than that. At first, all I felt was mild annoyance. I even thought, oh, I guess I won't finish my pic. Then, ten more people were in the line. I thought about asking the last person to prevent more people from entering, but I though, Hey, why bother? It's not as if there can be many more people in the store, right? Wrong. As I widdled (another cool word) my way through the customers, MORE KEPT COMING. After barely having any ALL DAY, all of them swarmed like a hive of malevolent bees. GRRRRRR... This time I DID ask the last person to keep others out. Everyone seemed to be amused. I was the only cashier, where would other people go? I explained that they could check out at the service deck, which was an exhausting 25 ft away (I was more polite though). Finnally. It was 8:05 and I was on my last customer. I was irratated that I wouldn't have enough time to get the Nerf gun, but other than that I was just eager to get home. Ahhh...those last customers. I think they were sent just to try my patience. First of all, they bought a few expensive items. They gave me a gift card, and they still had $59 left to pay. They tried to pay with credit, but it turned out they didn't have enough dough in their account to pay. So, they wrote me a check for half the ammount, and then tried to pay the rest with credit. The credit machine froze. After fiddling with it for a few minutes, I walked those hazardous 25ft to the service desk to ask for assistance. I waited while the person delt with a customer. I heard someone call my name. MY customers were frantically gestering to me. So I walked back. It seems that they had overestimated their credit account. BUT, their boyfriends showed up and gave them 5 bucks, so they gave THAT to me and then paid the rest with credit. They left, I closed up. I shut my register off at 8:20 pm. I glanced outside and saw my parental waiting on me. I angrily stalked all the way to the back, and clocked out. Then I stalked back and got in the car, at 8:30pm. I was furious. I had suppressed ALL emotions while actually working, but as soon as I stepped away from that register my dam broke and I was awash in them. Gah! Suppression of self (my technique for dealing with any situation involving strangers) just applified my anger by suppressing it. By the time I got home, all I wanted to do was mutilate and slaughter helpless animals on my favorite video game (supposidly, the point of the game is to save the world, but I just like shooting the life like animals). Of course, when I got to the PS2...the game was not there. I had left it in my OLD PS2 that I had taken with me on my vacation. The PS2 is in a box, right next to me at this very moment. The game is inside it. I COULD plug it in and obtain the game...but by now I have mostly excorized my emotions by reliving them by adding to this Longest Text Ever. I KNOW it was a petty thing to get angry about...but I didn't want to job to begin with. (And poor, poor Bag...) I never WANTED a job where you might not get off on time...like my friends always complained about McDonalds. Like them, if there are still customers...I can't leave! To make matters worse, it doesn't even feel as if I am working for money, since all I earn goes in a bank account for my future use. I am present oriented! I don't care about some hypothetical future! It's as if I am working for the sole purpose of making my dad happy. Eh...well...enough whining from me... Seeya. Hiya! And I have a GREAT conspiracy/paranoid rant! Don't you just feel all warm and gooey inside, like melted cheese? Suprisingly enough, this is the topic of today's rant: cheese. Mmmmmmmm...cheese. Mild Cheddar, Mozzerella, Feta, Montery Jack, Colby...Mmmmm...or what about that Queso Blanco they use in Mexican resteraunts? Mmmmm... I love cheese, and chances are: You love it, too. There are even commercials, just for cheese. Not even a particular BRAND of cheese, just the entire CONCEPT of cheese. "Ahhhh, the power of cheese!" And I couldn't agree more. But...it HAS come to my attention somehow or another that this is and EVIL arrangement. Think about it for one moment. Have you EVER seen a commercial urging you to buy, for instance, burgers? Just burgers. In general. No mention of McDonald's or Wendy's, or those frozen Bubba Burgers. Just...ya' know, the CONCEPT of burgers? How about pain medication? Bannanas? Milk? Ah! There we go. Milk. Just about EVERYONE has seen those GOT MILK? commercials. Every school in my county has a cafeteria chock FULL of posters of celebraties with milk mustaches, with the logo: GOT MILK? Hmmmmm...sooooooooo...just WHAT do CHEESE and MILK have in common? Let's see...BOTH are owned by the United Dairy Farmers of America. Hmmm...and it seems that OTHER countries have similar such organizations. In fact, there is even a CHICKEN Farmers organization (although apparantly it is not United). But other food stuffs organizations just don't seem to be as active as these mysterious dairy farmers. Hmmmm... Why bother to advertise a product, without bothering to promote a single company or brand name? Wouldn't you think that the companies could handle the advertising themselves? I know Kraft does: *sing*K-R-A-F-T. And lots of companies harp on the ammount of calcium in cheese. Sooo..why do the FARMERS advertise milk and cheese? Is it all a vast conspiracy? After all, this mysterious, spooky organization owns ALL THE CHEESE. Shocking, isn't it? So, this complete monopoly of the cheese world controls virtually all prices for all cheese/dairy items, including: Cheese Pizza, Ice Cream, Milk, Cheese, CheeseBurgers, Tacos, Cheesy Bread, Cheese Doritos, Nacho Cheese, Butter, Etc. (Etc. is not actually a dairy product, consisitng mostly of an ecletic mix of random items, but I figured that it would work to show the continuing theme of dairy type items. ) Why does the government allow such a monopoly to exist? Are they FUNDED by the government? Let's see *does a google search* Ooooo! Pay Dirt! I'm not the only one to see the evils of Got Milk! THIS SITE has an arcticle about the anger of small dairy farmers for the monopoly of the "Got Milk?" people. Jeff Manning, Executive Director of the California Milk Processor Board is apparantly in charge of this. What a strange title. Hmmmm...*scans the article* Oooo! They notice the non-brand-specific advertising! And it says how they are funded: "So-called “generic” advertising programs such as “Got Milk?” and “Ahh, the power of cheese” are funded, in part, through the congressionally authorized dairy checkoff, which places a mandatory assessment of 15 cents per hundredweight (roughly two cents per gallon) on all milk domestically produced and marketed commercially. Last year, the dairy checkoff raked in more than $250 million in hard-earned dairy producer money. " Soooo in essence, they ARE funded by the government (or at least in the sense that the government STEALS the small dairy farmer's money to pay for the ads). And they were sued by a small farmer who said: "We’re against having to fork over a huge portion of our bottom line for advertising that says all milk is equal." So they don't WANT to pay for the ads, but the government (and that California Dairy thingy) say they have to. Ha! That's hilarious! These stupid Dairy Conglomorate people are actually PAYING a town to rename itself "Got Milk" with those small dairy farmer's money! That's so pointless! It's like they are having these HUGE brain-storming sessions to see how they can best squander those small dairy people's money! "Hmmmm...Bob, why don't we buy all those "Largest Block of Cheese" roadside attractions and make a monument with them, entitled 'Ahhh, the power of cheese!'?" "Brilliant, Ted! But, I'd like to go one step further! Let's make an entire CITY out of cheese!" "Bob, that's it! Wait...wait! I think I GOT IT! Let's BUY a CITY the idiot yokels to CHANGE THEIR NAME TO GOT MILK! That way, we can still have those cheese ideas to fall back on afterwards!" *shakes head* It's so pathetic. *does happy dance* See, here I was ranting and raving about this, and it turns out that there already ARE people outraged! It's like that rant about the smoke detectors, and later I saw a movie about spy cameras in them. Or that Grape Pie Rant that ended up with me doing a google search months later (When I was bored) and discovering a pic of it...mmmm....grape pie. It's incredible how many strange things I can get outraged about, only to discover that they aren't strange at all! Well...seeya! Wootage! I'm back! And I have a new rant about the evils of parental brain-washing during childhood. Consider it a combo of the "Tag" rant and the "Mary Had a Little Lamb" rant. *shudders* How could I have missed such obvious implecations!? Gah! I shall focus! Alright...the subject of today's whatchamacallit is: Duck, Duck, Goose! It is EVIL! Now, I KNOW that most of what small children learn is actually not-so-cleveraly disguised brain-washing attempts, but this is just plain wrong! For those of you not familiar with the game, let me summarize. One child is "it" (JUST like in Tag). This child, labels each of the children, usually as "duck". The other children are sitting in a circle, and the "it" child walks around tapping their heads, going: "Duck, Duck, Duck"... Simple enough, right? Ah, but THEN the "it" child picks somebody ELSE to be "it", and tap the unfortunate victim on the head, crying "Goose!". Then the "goose" must pursue the "it" one and attempt to tag them. If they do not tag the "it" child, the "goose" becomes "it". If they succede in tagging them, the "it" child goes in the "mush pot" and the "goose" becomes "it" anyway. Alright. Now you know what the game IS...let's move onto what it MEANS. First of all, the game is CLEARLY a mock witch hunt. The children alienate and ostracize the one who is different, the one who is a "goose" when everyone else are "ducks". The "it" child is the current pariah, and obviously wants to exchange situations with a more fortunate child. So, the "it" child desperatly accuses another of being a "goose" (just as condemned witches accused others of witchcraft in order to alleviate their sentence). The child, symbolically shocked and appaled by such wild accusations, denies it, and even goes so far as to pursue the accusing pariah. If the accusation is deemed false (i.e. the "goose" tags the "it") then the accusing "it" child is sent to exile (the mush pot). HOWEVER, the taint of suspicion is already upon the former "goose" and despite protestations to the contrary, the child is the new "it" pariah. And the game continues. This game is DESIGNED to teach children how to shun those who are different, and to ostracize them from society if neccessary! How can this POSSIBLY be one of those little life's lessons that children must learn to become Responsible Adults? *shakes head in disgust* Well, anyway, that's it for today! Seeya! I'm back! *giggles wildly* Woot! I have something EXTRA SPECIAL for you loyal readers *cricket chirps yet again...what is UP with that?*! "Meg", the inspiration to that Pointless Signs of America Rant, has "agreed" to do a rant for us! It's GREAT! *giggles* Well, here it is: "Meg" here. Jenny has kindly asked aka threatened me to do a guest rant, and I am only too happy to oblige. So here I am ready to inform you of silly things! Let's start! Go! Go! It has come to my attention that Barbie has finally found a new love. That's right. Bye-bye to boring Ken! Here comes Australian surfer Blaine! At this point, a few of you will be screaming: "No! Ken and Barbie forevaaaaa!" An insane percentage of you will be going: "Oh, that is so cute, Barbie and Blaine! That's great cause, like, both of their names start with B! Heehee!" But most of you will be wondering if that leftover pizza a week ago that is still in the fridge is eatable. Trust me on this, it's not. So why am I bringing this up? How many of you remember playing with Barbies? (The guys reading this.pretend it's G.I. Joe and his buddies.) Remember when you ripped off Barbie's head and it gave that satisfying pop? And how there was always one Ken doll and a whole bunch of Barbies? And Ken had to choose from his little harem which one he wanted? It was actually training to make you used to Reality TV! The Bachelor is eerily similar to the game you played as a child. Ken has to choose between Vet Barbie, Cowgirl Barbie, Teacher Barbie, and Dolphin Trainer Barbie! There's also a million dollars thrown into the mix! (Guys: G.I. Joe has to decide which of his buddies to vote off the island or something.) Ken was always a favored one! But now with him gone, (Barbie was quoted saying something like, "So long, ya pansy!) how will young girls (and boys) tolerate Reality TV when they are older? Mattel and TV producers are realizing their mistakes, so they decided to hold a vote for the "new man" of Barbie. This vote again was a little Reality TV thing in progress. The Bachelorette this time. Who will Barbie choose? The trendy new guy she chose which, over 2 million people decided, was Blaine. Now, girls (and boys) will be racing to get him and the many clothes and surfboard accessories he will undoubtedly have. Marketing goes up, and a new generation of potential Reality TV watchers is created. The endless cycle continues. I hope you enjoyed my rant! And remember! May Blaine always help the masses decide: American Idol Barbie or Survivor Barbie. Wasn't that GREAT!? *giggles* I luvs it! Ahhhh...the joys of paranoid conspiracy ranting without any of the effort! Go, "Meg"! Well...er...seeya! Well, I’m back! *waits for applause* … … … … ANYWAY, today I am here with a very special treat for you loyal *insert random insect noise here* readers! Don’t you feel extra squishy? I’m here to “advertise” a wonderful product found ONLY (to my knowledge) at K-Mart (where I am a Cashier Slave of questionable Loyalty). Okay, here goes the commercial I have prepared: How would YOU like your four-year-old sibling/cousin/offspring/neighbor/pest to have ALL the fun and excitement of BIKING with none of those annoying little distractions, like being able to STOP at will? Well, you are in luck, Hapless Victim, because have WE the bike for YOU! Introducing the Tyke Byke (not actual product name) now with 100% less brakes! Wasn’t that fun AND entertaining? Seriously, though, I was bored and waiting for my shift to start (we can’t clock in early) and I happened to wonder into the bike section. And I found a box with a picture of a happy little girl on it, wearing her helmet. The box listed features of the bike, and (off to the side, in one of those happy little many-pointed stars where they usually write stuff like FREE!) was the words No Brakes! Like this was a GOOD thing! What the …? I thought brakes HELPED YOU! And to think, after all these years I have been wrong!? But seriously, can you IMAGINE the Marketing committee that designed this thing? I figure it was made of, say, Hitler, a cannibal, Satan and Mary Poppins (anyone else creeped out by her?) Here was their justifying equation (which I obtained through highly classified means, namely, a squirrel, a pack of walnuts and a mini-camera) Toddler + Tyke Byke + highway = hours of fun! I figure they WANTED small children to go careening into random objects. Why else would they give ‘em no brakes? Anyway, I better go, I have this GREAT idea for a gun without a safety, and a very sensitive trigger. ..Wow..I"m back......it's been an entire year...and here I am again...pointlessly ranting and raving. Today's topic is Quaker Oats! You know Quaker Oats, right? Do a google search and find a picture, I dare you. Chances are you'll find a creepy looking older white guy dressed all old fasioned...if that's not bad enough: read on. It turns out that Quaker Oats OWNS the Aunt Jemima syrup company. Aunt Jemima is symbolized by a middle aged african american woman. Now, let's think....hrrm...the time frame that the Quaker Oats guy is from...plus owning a middle aged african american woman...wait a minute! Are they implying that she's a slave!? What kind of public image are they trying to portray here!? The NERVE of that company! *shakes head* They really need to have a better publicist.... Ah well, there's your LTE rant of the day/week/month/year/insert time frame ehre. Enjoy ^^ Heh, well, I’m once again back. This time from a long hiatus involving College life, kiwi’s and cannibalism ^_^ But let’s ignore that for now, shall we? Today we have MUCH more important things to discuss ^_^ Like a certain warranty on a certain pair of a certain headphones at a certain store that a certain someone works at a certain summer after returning from a certain college. Like most warranties, it guarantees the safety of the product for a limited time, and promises you fame, fortune, and your money back if it breaks during that time. That, however, is where this warranties similarities to the norm cease. Are you ready? *waits* How ‘bout now? *wait wait* STILL not ready? Bah, forget you, I’ll go on anyway. *clears throat* I shall now paraphrase the warranty to you, in all it’s arcane glory and splendor. This warranty shall not be in effect in the cases in which :

1.) The product is purposefully damaged. 2.) The product is accidentally damaged. 3.) An act of God damages the product.
……….*pause for effect* There you have it folks. This beee-autiful warranty will NEVER be in effect. It just won’t. No matter what happens, the company issuing the warranty can just blame it on God. I can just see just such a scenario playing out in my head…….*wavy thought lines scene transition indicating an imaginary scene*

Ted: Yes, I’m calling to cash in on my 90-day money back warranty?

Customer Service Agent: *snicker* Oh really? *polite, polite* Would you please describe the damage or malfunction your purchase is experiencing?

Ted: …it just stopped working.

Customer Service Agent: *dripping with phony concern* Oh, gee, sir…but it seems that “just stopped working” falls under our “Act of God” clause, and our company cannot be held responsible for any vendettas that God may have against you.

Ted:…………….you’re telling me that because God hates me, my headphones stopped working? And that you won’t give me my money back?

Customer Service Agent: *can’t hold it in any longer* *laughing until they gasp* Oh…God…that gets me every time…*gasp* *giggle* That’s just great….Sir, I suggest *wheeze* That you go to Church…*snicker* And see if you can’t convince God to fix it for you….*guffaw* Because…you’re waaaaaaaay more likely to get him to reimburse you then us! *hangs up*

So, you see? I am extremely impressed by this quick thinking company. If only I, too, could think of a way to so totally, and successfully scam my customers. Oh. Wait. I do. Every day, ……darn those Customer Service Plans! How stupid does a customer have to be to think that they should pay $20 now to insure their purchase of some stupid grill? If it breaks it would probably take 10 bucks to fix it. *sigh* Why must K-mart compromise my honor? Ack! I spoke its name! *flee* Alright I'm Baaaa~ack! That's right. Back from the dead like a fiery phoenix of nonsense and ranting, I return from months and months of not posting (and to make things even more interesting i won't mention anywhere else on the site that I made a new lte post!) So, today's topic is just on the concept of writing. I go to a very math oriented college (i'm gonna be a programmer) so the people here....just....really...suck at writing. Completely! *happy* So for a small nominal $50* fee I shall teach you, the Hypothetical Reader, how to write grade A quality stories, guaranteed! ** (* $50 shall be payable in invisible, imaginary Official Flaming Chickens Lunar Colony's Dollars (approx $1 OFCLC is $1,337,000,000,00 in US dollars, circa 1957) ** not a guarantee) So are you ready? Let's start with a basic story even a kindergartner would write!

Once upon a time there was a princess and a witch was making her sad but then a handsome prince came and killed the witch and made the princess happy. really happy. i mean really, really happy. sometime three or four times a night. and they lived happily ever after.


What a touching story, right? Let's see here, what basic story elements are we missing...Why don't we check the formula for a successfull story, shall we?

good story = plot + character development + orginality


I could continue, but I'm alread bored. Cya! ^_^
